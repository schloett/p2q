[{"title": "Attachment disorder.", "abstract": " (from the publicity materials) A child\u2019s close bond with mother, father, or guardian usually provides a foundation for trust in all future attachments. Children deprived of early and healthy dependency\u2014who do not form normal attachment with their caregivers\u2014may later suffer from Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD). This childhood disorder is characterized by a general failure in social relationships resulting from pathogenic care. Although first included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III) in 1980, RAD is one of the more uncommon and understudied forms of psychopathology.

The case-based approach used in this Brief follows the representative case of \u201cJorge,\u201d presented as unfolding over time and structured to illustrate challenges of diagnosis, to show examples of co-morbidity, and to provoke reflection on what questions may arise during treatment. Readers are asked to appraise the overlap with other clinical syndromes, the forms of psychotherapy which may apply, and the potential role of psychiatric medications as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.

The study focused primarily on four complementary aspects of validity: construct validity, discriminant validity, longitudinal stability, and functional impairment. The differentiation of two distinct RAD subtypes, characterized by social inhibition and by disinhibition, appears warranted. RAD is distinct from other better-established early childhood disorders, with a particularly clear separation of the RAD-disinhibited subtype from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. RAD correlates with child functional impairment, even after controlling for key factors such as low IQ. The finding that many children with disinhibited RAD show organized attachment patterns at 54 months of age further supports the idea that placing attachment insecurity and/or disorganization at the core of RAD is misguided.

Its etiology is hypothesized as related to failure of attachment beginning in infancy. Although the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is usually made in early childhood, the diagnosis may be carried over into adolescence. In some cases, the diagnosis may be made for the first time in adolescence if there is sufficient information in the history to make the diagnosis retrospectively. It is unlikely that the diagnosis of RAD can be made in the absence of comorbid diagnoses in adolescence because these children usually have symptoms which meet the criteria for other diagnoses, such as attention deficit disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), mood disorder, or conduct disorder (CD) by the time they become early or mid-adolescent ages. During development, additional diagnostic criteria for other DSM-IV diagnoses may be observed. Although a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, ODD, and/or CD might appear to take precedence over RAD, with the burgeoning information in genetics it may be useful to know that RAD was present or may still be present in the symptom complex of an individual patient.

Although disinhibited RAD is most commonly observed in institutionalised children, similar behaviours may also be a part of the emotional difficulties displayed by some fostered and adopted children (the latter includes those once institutionalised), and these may demonstrate not so much a discrete attachment disorder as either the need to fend for oneself following loss of dedicated caregiving or a lack of opportunity to build specific intimate relationships with dedicated caregivers. In many cases this may be inextricably mixed with the neurobiological and psychological seqelae of maltreatment. Indiscriminate attachment behaviour, from this proposed evolutionary perspective, is less a syndrome of mental ill-health than an astute survival manoeuvre following being orphaned, abandoned or fecklessly reared. Such a response, allied to the innate facility to access caregiving from different adults, could be expected to be initiated by specific events as are the other attachment configurations.

BPD affects 1-2% of the general population, 10% of the patients in outpatient settings, 15-20% of the patients in inpatients settings and 30-60% of the patients diagnosed with personality disorders. BPD is most commonly assessed according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM). In addition, assessment of BPD features on a quantitative or dimensional scale is increasingly used. BPD is more often diagnosed in women in clinical samples and in young individuals and is frequently co-morbid with other personality disorders and axis-I disorders. Most studies on BPD have attempted to clarify the etiology in terms of social and environmental determinants (e.g. physical or sexual abuse). These factors are important contributors to risk, but do not explain all variation in BPD risk. Moreover, even if the association is significant, in many instances the direction of causality is unclear. Genetic factors are additional contributors to BPD risk, and there now are some large twin and family studies that suggest significant heritability for the disorder as well as for the quantitative assessment. In this chapter, we first discuss the main symptoms of BPD and several assessment methods. Next, we consider the association between BPD and demographic characteristics, such as age and sex, and the co-morbidity with other disorders. After the focus on environmental covariates, we review family and twin studies into the genetics of BPD and related traits, genetic linkage and candidate gene studies of BPD.

People who suffer from PTSD often relive the experience through nightmares and flashbacks, have difficulty sleeping, and feel detached or estranged, and these symptoms can be severe enough and last long enough to significantly impair the person's daily life. This new book presents leading research from around the world. Chapter 1 summarizes current progress in research related to the recognition, diagnosis and treatment for PTSD. In chapter 2, a brief review of the neurosteroids is presented along with published studies and preliminary reports on dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or its sulphated metabolite DHEAS in PTSD. A revised associative functional analysis (AFA) model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is outlined in chapter 3. The persistent physiological effects of an unhealed injury and impairment are reflected in mood disorders, cognitive dysfunctions, and impairment which are discussed in chapter 4. In chapter 5, two cohorts of Cuban refugee children and adolescents who migrated with their parents by sea and were later confined to refugee camps were assessed for symptoms of Post-traumatic stress disorder during refugee camp confinement. The long-term effects of Holocaust survivors who were children during the war is the focus of chapter 6. Chapter 7 rethinks the role of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis in mental health services for refugees.

The five-factor model (FFM) of personality, consisting of the personality traits neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, is one of the proposed models to conceptualize personality disorders as maladaptive variants of continuously distributed personality traits. Methods The present study examined the phenotypic and genetic association between borderline personality and FFM personality traits. Data were available for 4403 monozygotic twins, 4425 dizygotic twins, and 1661 siblings from 6140 Dutch, Belgian, and Australian families. Results Broad-sense heritability estimates for neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness to experience, and borderline personality were 43%, 36%, 43%, 47%, 54%, and 45%, respectively. Phenotypic correlations between borderline personality and the FFM personality traits ranged from .06 for openness to experience to .68 for neuroticism. Multiple regression analyses showed that a combination of high neuroticism and low agreeableness best predicted borderline personality. Multivariate genetic analyses showed the genetic factors that influence individual differences in neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion account for all genetic liability to borderline personality. Unique environmental effects on borderline personality, however, were not completely shared with those for the FFM traits (33% is unique to borderline personality). Conclusions Borderline personality shares all genetic variation with neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion. The unique environmental influences specific to borderline personality may cause individuals with a specific pattern of personality traits to cross a threshold and develop borderline personality.", "identifiers": {"issn": "0006-3223", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.07.017"}, "source": "Neural Mechanisms of Cognitive Impairment and Aggression in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder", "authors": [{"first_name": "Marijn A", "last_name": "Distel"}, {"first_name": "Timothy J", "last_name": "Trull"}, {"first_name": "Gonneke", "last_name": "Willemsen"}, {"first_name": "Jacqueline M", "last_name": "Vink"}, {"first_name": "Catherine A", "last_name": "Derom"}, {"first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Lynskey"}, {"first_name": "Nicholas G", "last_name": "Martin"}, {"first_name": "Dorret I", "last_name": "Boomsma"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/fivefactor-model-personality-borderline-personality-disorder-genetic-analysis-comorbidity-1", "year": 2009, "keywords": ["Borderline personality disorder", "five-factor model", "genetics", "personality", "twin study"], "type": "journal", "id": "c6d4dbbc-b736-3c14-b58a-968d0273ac1b"}, {"title": "Rethinking the Role of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Refugee Mental Health Services", "abstract": "This chapter rethinks the role of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis in mental health services for refugees.

An 'appropriately supportive environment' may be a mitigating factor in terms of the disorder's severity and duration (Corbin, 2007); therefore it is important that behaviours suggestive of RAD are recognised early and that these children are given the attention they require in the care setting. We aimed to gain an understanding of residential childcare workers' knowledge of RAD to determine if their understanding of RAD was sufficient to recognise RAD-like behaviour. Method: A mixed methods study (qualitative focus groups and whole population survey) was undertaken with residential childcare workers. Results: Liaison with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services was seen by residential workers as being useful and workers thought their knowledge of mental health problems had improved in recent years. However, less than half of respondents (49.1%) identified RAD from a case history given in the questionnaire. Conclusions: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services staff and residential workers may need more specialised training on RAD to be able to recognise behaviours suggestive of the disorder and refer appropriately, ensuring the child's needs are met as early as possible. Key Practitioner Message: Residential care workers are likely to come into contact with Reactive Attachment Disorder in their work Residential care workers view a consultative relationship with Child and Adolescent Mental Health service workers as highly supportive Although these residential workers had a good understanding of attachment theory and were also familiar with some of the symptoms of RAD, less than half of the sample recognised these symptoms as belonging to that diagnostic category It is important that children with RAD are recognised and referred to CAMHS, despite there being a poor evidence-base for treatment, because a full understanding of their complex problems is likely to lead to better management", "identifiers": {"issn": "1475357X", "isbn": "1475-357X", "doi": "10.1111/j.1475-3588.2010.00575.x"}, "source": "Child and Adolescent Mental Health", "authors": [{"first_name": "Lauren", "last_name": "Ferguson"}, {"first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Follan"}, {"first_name": "Marlene", "last_name": "Macinnes"}, {"first_name": "Judith", "last_name": "Furnivall"}, {"first_name": "Helen", "last_name": "Minnis"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/residential-childcare-workers-knowledge-reactive-attachment-disorder", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["Reactive attachment disorder", "Residential childcare"], "type": "journal", "id": "ea14e430-71fa-39e1-a23a-a42ee11ae70e"}, {"title": "Reactive Attachment Disorder and International Adoption: a Systematic Synthesis.", "abstract": "Adoption of children from foreign countries by families in the United States and other countries is on the rise.

Afterwards participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging while aversive tension, heart rate and heart rate variability were assessed. Results We found a significant influence of incision on subjective and objective stress levels with a stronger decrease of aversive tension in the borderline personality disorder group following incision than sham. Amygdala activity decreased more and functional connectivity with superior frontal gyrus normalised after incision in the borderline personality disorder group.

The phenomenology and epidemiology of narcissistic personality disorder (PD) is discussed first. Next is a discussion of the incidence of depression comorbidity among people with narcissistic PD. Theories on the factors surrounding narcissistic PD are accompanied by a discussion of treatments and countertransference in therapy. A case synopsis of a patient (\"Tom\u00e1s\") with narcissistic PD and depression comorbidity rounds out the discussion. Guided by Tom\u00e1s's personality and his need for unconditional positive regard, therapy began by using a humanistic approach, using empathy and validation and examining the client's thwarted actualizing tendency. The emphasis then shifted to cognitive-behavioral interventions to challenge Tomas's beliefs about himself and others. Individuals with narcissistic PD also often pair with individuals with dependent PD. When treating individuals with narcissistic PD, maintaining rapport is often a substantial challenge. Blithely supporting the narcissist's grandiosity all but abandons any hope of therapeutic progress, whereas confrontation undertaken precipitously can undermine a fragile bond. Managing countertransference is often the most difficult problem the therapist faces. In my experience, concurrent mild to moderate depression generally facilitates motivation, thus adding to the probability of therapeutic success. All of these elements were demonstrated in the case of Tom\u00e1s. Initially, the focus was validation in order to secure the relationship. As the therapy evolved, Dr. Mark Johns managed his countertransference using mindfulness-based techniques; when he (Dr. Johns) was more centered, he was able to compassionately confront the client's grandiosity and lack of empathy. Tom\u00e1s's depression and PD resolved in concert with one another. Depression in narcissistic PD requires a great deal of further research. Little is known about the biology of narcissistic PD, even though its heritability appears to be similar to that of other PD. Understanding the basic neurological mechanisms associated with the disorder may lead to improvements in both psychotherapy and medication management. Although I have argued that mild to moderate depression facilitates psychotherapeutic intervention with individuals with narcissistic PD, further research is needed to verify this hypothesis as well as to confirm other aspects of the relationship between depression and narcissistic PD.", "identifiers": {"isbn": "1591474108"}, "source": "Depression", "authors": [{"first_name": "Depressionhistrionic Personality", "last_name": "Disorder"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/depression-narcissistic-personality-disorder-1", "year": 1974, "type": "journal", "id": "8169cf4d-5051-35d9-9336-b8470545477f"}, {"title": "The Biology of Borderline Personality Disorder", "abstract": "Genetics and environmental stressors and events play a decisive role in the emergence of the core dimensions of borderline personality disorder (BPD): (1) affective dysregulation; (2) impulsivity; and (3) dissociative behavior spectrum with self injury. In BPD patients, the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is affected, and hippocampal and amygdala atrophy is seen. EEG slowing, abnormalities in evoked potentials, elevation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep density, higher acoustic startle responses, prolonged habituation in the electromyogram, and increased amygdala activation are among the correlates of affective dysregulation. Reduced serotonergic transmission and prefrontal dysfunction resulting in limbic disinhibition are among the correlates of impulsive aggression. Brain imaging studies show the importance of limbic and prefrontal areas in the generation of dissociative symptoms; self-injurious behavior seems to relieve dysphoria and analgesia possibly via the release of endogenous opioids. Evidence supports the use of dialectic behavior therapy to modify a number of these key features and of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics when used in a symptom-targeted manner.

It was through the club and within the walls of the Camp Nou stadium that Catalunya was able to sustain its identity. The end of the Franco regime has created new opportunities for national expression and political solutions and the forces of globalisation have expanded Bar\u00e7a's fan base beyond the borders of Catalunya and now includes many who do not identify with the Catalan cause.

The research examines FC Barcelona as a case of a caring organisation developing a global identity via productive resistance within a regional national culture. FC Barcelona is a deviant example in its display of a caring relationship towards others. This study highlights productive resistance as a practice of caring and discusses the reciprocal relationship between the caring organisation and resistance. The purpose of this study is to explain how domination can induce productive resistance, which can lead to the creation of caring organisations. Positive exposure to diversity reinforces plural identities, which are amplified by acts of productive resistance. This research builds on the notion of caring as a productive form of resistance in an effort to explain the increasing emergence of caring organisations on the international stage. The study shows how caring can be a productive response to domination. Resistance, in the case of FC Barcelona as an institution of a minority culture, is understood as a form of care.

The market forces that have defined commercialization, notably pay-per-view television, whilst initially welcomed as important new sources of revenue, have also had the unanticipated consequences of de-stabilizing many sporting competitions and institutions, undermining the financial future of clubs in their traditional role as key social and cultural institutions. This has been manifested in the paradox of chronic financial loss-making amongst professional sports\u2019 clubs in an era of exponential revenue growth, a trend exemplified by the experience of Italy\u2019s Series A and the English Premier League \u2013 both cases examined in detail in this book. But, at the same time, some traditional sporting organizations have sought with some success, to chart a middle way, retaining traditional sporting movement objectives whilst also embracing a form of commercialism.

Towards the end of nineteenth century, Europe suddenly woke up to the riches that lay in the vast unexplored continent to its south, and the 'scramble for Africa' began. By the start of the First World War, almost all of the continent had been taken by European powers. The rights of Africa's own people, who lost land and many lives during this process, drew scant attention.  Why recall this episode today? Fleetingly, last summer, Africa was big news, when it became the central topic at a meeting in Scotland of the leaders of the G8 group of top industrialized nations, chaired by British prime minister Tony Blair. Yet the real action is being taken by a donor nation that isn't even a member of the G8: China.  The G8 nations \u2014 correctly, if belatedly \u2014 are considering how best to invest in Africa, so that the previous misappropriation and mismanagement can be avoided. China seems to have no such qualms. Across the continent, from Zimbabwe to Sudan, China is winning friends by lending money to Africa's most unsavoury regimes without asking awkward questions.  As a News story on page 393 of this issue illustrates, scientists and engineers are sometimes complicit with this process. Sudan's Merowe dam on the Nile could be set to repeat the mistakes that have characterized previous large-scale hydropower projects in poor countries. Studies of how to resettle 50,000 people whose land will be flooded, and assessments of the project's environmental impact, were finished late in the day, and undertaken with insufficient rigour. They would have stopped the project going ahead if the World Bank, for example, was funding it.  Lahmeyer International, the German company that is coordinating the project, is disarmingly open about why this is so. It says that funders such as the World Bank make things too complicated. Thorough environmental and social impact assessments take years; Sudan wants power now. China is willing to invest, in part to cement closer ties with an important oil producer. And the Sudanese government lacks the political infrastructure \u2014 and probably the political will \u2014 to enforce proper safeguards. So, once again, thousands of poor people look set to suffer so that a big dam project can go ahead.  The project's backers have sought to portray Merowe as a necessary trade-off between the competing needs of development and the rights of local people. But there is no reason why both needs can't be met. Hydropower certainly has a role to play in Africa's development. Most of the continent's available hydropower resources are untapped and could, if properly harnessed, provide a valuable and renewable source of energy. But that doesn't mean that large dams need to be built. Successful projects in Asia and South America have shown that small hydropower projects can supply a few thousand local people without the need for big resettlement projects. Smaller projects can be run with more input from local people and are easier to combine with other renewable sources, such as solar power.      People's rights and needs are once again being sidelined in the stampede for wealth.  Unless the lessons of the past are thoroughly learned, large dam projects will sink over time in a morass of corruption, haphazard displacement of local people, lack of political accountability, and failure to plan properly for maintenance.  South Africa has, to its credit, tried to incorporate some of these lessons into a hydropower and water-supply project in Lesotho. The project is imperfect, but at least its administrators have sought to consult with local people and to run independent assessments of its environmental impact. But South Africa, with its wealth and its relatively sophisticated political system, is an exception.  In many other African nations, there is little chance of proper safeguards being implemented. Chinese firms and government agencies will operate with few checks or balances. The same goes for the European companies involved in Merowe and elsewhere. They know that rigorous political consultation and environmental assessment are needed if big dam projects are to succeed. Yet they have been happy to engage in such projects in the absence of any such safeguards. The staff and shareholders of these firms are part of another scramble for Africa, in which local peoples' rights and needs are once again being sidelined in the stampede for wealth.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-33645283868", "pmid": "16554759", "issn": "0028-0836", "doi": "10.1038/440383b"}, "source": "Nature", "authors": [{"first_name": "First World", "last_name": "War"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/scramble-africa-2", "year": 2006, "type": "journal", "id": "d6b7ca15-5198-36b5-a800-04ecffd54768"}, {"title": "The origins of the First World War", "abstract": "James Joll's study is not simply another narrative, retracing the powder trail that was finally ignited at Sarajevo.

Located in the suburban borough of Forest Hills, the laboratory was set up to provide scientific knowledge for the older materials testing and product development laboratories at the factory. Unlike its industrial counterparts, however, the Forest Hills laboratory was dominated by a strong engineering research tradition that disrupted efforts undertaken in the 1920s and again in the 1930s to build and sustain a diversified fundamental research program. Whereas Eastman Kodak, DuPont, AT&T, and General Electric had successfully integrated fundamental research into their corporate laboratories, the Forest Hills laboratory remained the site of recurring tensions between two cultures of innovation - one based on fundamental science, the other on engineering research. Although such tensions often resulted in competing research strategies, managerial conflicts, and mismatched corporate priorities, the long-standing culture of engineering research contributed far more to Westinghouse's strategic growth than even the most advanced fundamental research. More generally, the interactions between the cultures of engineering and science that characterize the early history of industrial research at Westinghouse highlight the evolving and sometimes conflicting patterns of technological innovation and organizational change in American industry before World War II.

Adult education programs serving this population can play an important role in helping learners develop the skills they need to succeed in postsecondary education and to obtain, retain, and advance in employment. Given the skills needed for the high-demand occupations of the future, it is increasingly important that adult education programs expand the scope of opportunities offered so that adults learning English are prepared with the language, knowledge, and skills they need to be successful, whether their immediate goals include gaining a vocational training certificate, an associate's degree, a bachelor's degree, or a specific job. This brief reviews the literature on the skills needed for adult English language learners to transition to academic study and employment and the time it takes to develop those skills. It then focuses on the results of a recent survey completed by the authors, which revealed instructors' perceptions of skills needed by learners in order to be successful in academic programs. Finally, the brief offers examples of activities and strategies that can be used at beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels of English as a second language (ESL) instruction to help learners develop these skills. This brief is written for state adult education staff, program administrators, professional development staff and teacher trainers, teachers, education researchers, and policy makers. It describes a process for adult education staff to use data to plan professional development for practitioners who work with adults learning English.

It investigates the effect of boundary strength on two processes, namely pre-boundary lengthening and resolution of external (between-words) vowel hiatus on Modern Greek. Results show that a) pre-boundary lengthening is influenced by boundary strength in a hierarchical gradient manner, and b) degree of coalescence (F2 values at the mid point of vowels in hiatus) is not influenced by boundary strength.

In the past, landscapes have been managed on an ownership basis. However, experience has shown that the old methods of land management do not make biological sense. Most biological processes do not stop at an ownership boundary. Animal species migrate across private and public lands (as long as they can get over the fences). Contiguous forested lands may traverse many ownerships. Streams flow across different ownerships and political boundaries. What has been proposed as a logical unit of land management is a watershed. What is a watershed? The American Heritage Dictionary defines watersheds as: \"The region draining into a river, river system, or body of water.\" Watersheds are always physically delineated by the area upstream from a given outlet point. This generally means that for a stream network, the contributing area upstream to a ridge line. Ridgelines separate watersheds from each other. Thus, the Columbia River has a watershed extending into a very large region of North America, from the Washington-Oregon border north into British Columbia, South into Oregon, and east to the Continental Divide. The Columbia River watershed is defined by the area upstream from its outlet into the Pacific Ocean. But the Columbia River has many tributaries. The Salmon, Snake, Willamette, are but a few other rivers contributing to the flow of the Columbia. Where these rivers meet the Columbia can be treated as outlet points for each individual tributary, and so on, up the hydrologic network of streams and sub-basins.", "authors": [{"first_name": "P", "last_name": "Schiess"}], "source": "Computer Program", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/esrm-250-introduction-geographic-information-systems-forest-resources", "year": 2005, "type": "book_section", "id": "810e7541-a0e8-3957-8072-de4c120690ac"}, {"title": "Basic code of Moore's Transfer functions for correcting eddy fluxes", "abstract": "This program corrects for signal attenuation due to a finite ' path of the sonics, hygrometer and CO2 irgas.

Why didn't Spain enter World War II? In what ways did Spain collaborate with the Third Reich? How much did Spain assist Jewish refugees? This is the first book in any language to answer these intriguing questions. Stanley Payne, a leading historian of modern Spain, explores the full range of Franco's relationship with Hitler, from 1936 to the fall of the Reich in 1945. But as Payne brilliantly shows, relations between these two dictators were not only a matter of realpolitik. These two titanic egos engaged in an extraordinary tragicomic drama often verging on the dark absurdity of a Beckett or Ionesco play. Whereas Payne investigates the evolving relationship of the two regimes up to the conclusion of World War II, his principal concern is the enigma of Spain's unique position during the war, as a semi-fascist country struggling to maintain a tortured neutrality. Why Spain did not enter the war as a German ally, joining with Hitler to seize Gibraltar and close the Mediterranean to the British navy, is at the center of Payne's narrative. Franco's only personal meeting with Hitler, in 1940 to discuss precisely this, is recounted here in groundbreaking detail that also sheds significant new light on the Spanish government's vacillating policy toward Jewish refugees, on the Holocaust, and on Spain's German connection throughout the duration of the war. \u00a9 2008 by Stanley G.

While in Berlin in September 1937 for lectures to the Jung Gesellschaft, his observations of Hitler at a military parade led him to conclude that should the catastrophe of war come it would be far more and bloodier than he had previously supposed. After the Sudetenland Crisis in Fall 1938, Jung in interviews made stronger comments on Hitler and Nazi Germany.

Muth demonstrates that the military education system in Germany represented an organized effort where each school and examination provided the stepping stone for the next. But in the United States, there existed no communication about teaching contents or didactical matters among the various schools and academies, and they existed in a self chosen insular environment. American officers who finally made their way through an erratic selection process and past West Point to the important Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, found themselves usually deeply disappointed, because they were faced again with a rather below average faculty who forced them after every exercise to accept the approved \"school solution.\" Command Culture explores the paradox that in Germany officers came from a closed authoritarian society but received an extremely open minded military education, whereas their counterparts in the United States came from one of the most democratic societies but received an outdated military education that harnessed their minds and limited their initiative. On the other hand, German officer candidates learned that in war everything is possible and a war of extermination acceptable. For American officers, raised in a democracy, certain boundaries could never be crossed. This work for the first time clearly explains the lack of audacity of many high ranking American officers during World War II, as well as the reason why so many German officers became perpetrators or accomplices of war crimes and atrocities or remained bystanders without speaking up. Those American officers who became outstanding leaders in World War II did so not so much because of their military education, but despite it. \u00a9 2011 by The University of North Texas Press All rights reserved.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84894938123", "isbn": "9781574413038"}, "source": "Command Culture: Officer Education in the U.S. Army and the German Armed Forces, 1901-1940, and the Consequences for World War II", "authors": [{"first_name": "J", "last_name": "Muth"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/command-culture-officer-education-army-german-armed-forces-19011940-consequences-world-war-ii", "year": 2011, "type": "book", "id": "d6a60810-e28c-310f-a1e5-116bd02fe2fd"}, {"title": "Men in German uniform: POWs in America during World War II", "abstract": "Examining the largest prisoner-of-war handling operation in U.S. history, this book offers a meticulous account of the myriad problems-as well as the impressive successes-that came with housing 371,000 German POWs on American soil during World War II. Antonio Thompson draws on extensive archival research to probe the various ways in which the U.S. government strove to comply with the Geneva Convention's mandate that enemy prisoners be moved from the war zone and given food, shelter, and clothing equal to that provided for American soldiers. While the prisoners became a ready source of manpower for the labor-starved American home front and received small wages in return, their stay in the United States generated more than a few difficulties, which included not only daunting logistics but also violence within the camps. Such violence was often blamed on Nazi influence and control; however, as Thompson points out, only a few of the prisoners were actually Nazis. Because the Germans had cobbled together military forces that included convicts, their own POWs, volunteers from neutral nations, and conscripts from occupied countries, the bonds that held these soldiers together amid the pressures of combat dissolved once they were placed behind barbed wire. When these \"men in German uniform,\" who were not always Germans, donned POW garb, their former social, racial, religious, and ethnic tensions quickly reemerged. To counter such troubles, American authorities organized various activities-including sports, arts, education, and religion-within the POW camps; some prisoners even participated in an illegal denazification program created by the U.S. government. Despite the problems, Thompson argues, the POW-housing program proved largely successful, as Americans maintained their reputation for fairness and humane treatment during a time of widespread turmoil.

The 'how' dimension refers to how costs and benefits of a potential regulation are weighed. The 'where' dimension refers to \"how the decision to introduce a given policy at a particular level of government - federal versus state, EU versus national - is made\". 'How' criteria have been institutionalised quite comfortably in both systems, whereas both the EU and the US have been uneasy about the 'where' criteria , theoretically implementing them, but without much impact (these criteria didn't find a \"natural home in central institutions\") p. 119 US attempts to add technocratic rationality to the procedures of determining at which level policy should be introduced, have failed. Executive Order 12291 addressed the 'how' issue; the 'where' issue was not added until later. p. 123-124 Reagan: EO 12291 (supplemented with EO 12498), benefits had to outweigh the costs to society. Clinton replaced these EO's with EO 12886 in 1993 (significant changes - timetable, only major regulations and sunshine provisions) but retained the review process); emphasis now requirement that \"each agency assess both the costs and the benefits of the intended regulation and, recognizing that some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify, propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs.\" p. 125 The 'where' dimension was introduced by EO 12612 (Reagan 1987) asserting \"the general superiority of policy-making at state level, madating very high tresholds for federal intervention\" [wat zijn 'unfunded mandates'? AM]. Replaced by 13083 (Clinton 1998, only briefly) and again by EO 13132 (Clinton 1999, a compromise) p. 126-127 Contrasting the Federalism Executive Orders. Regulatory preemption p. 130-131 \"The presidency's institutional need to gain some control over regulatory policy flow created regulatory review.\"  p. 131 lack of impact of federalism criteria, as they do not have a natural home in agencies or the OMB for that matter p. 132 EU. Again: QMV changed everything p. 132-133 In its most general meaning, subsidiarity describes \"the allocation or the use of authority within a political order where there is no unitary sovereign\"(Follesdal 1999). \"It mandates that a legislative action should not be taken at a higher level within a system unless this higher level is more effective in achieving the legislative goal (Trachtman 1997; Follesal 1999). 'Subsidiarity' carries different meanings and connotations for different constituencies, but always focuses on the \"question 'where' to regulate in a multi-tiered system. De B\u00farca 1999 two variations of subsidiarity: 'democratic' subsidiarity (bring legislative decision making as close to the citizen as possible) and 'executive' subsidiarity (Community law-makers or national legislatures) [ja, nagezocht in haar stuk; daar wel beter uitgewerkt AM] p. 133 \"(...) Art. 5 TEC forces the EU institutions, particularly the Commission, to examine Community competency not from a purely formal-legal, but also substantive viewpoint, with goal-oriented proportionality and regulatory efficiency\" p. 133-134 The Protocol lists two aspects of subsidiarity (without defining it): the 'necessity' criterion and the 'effectiveness criterion' to be substantiated by the Community \"by qualitative or, wherever possible, quantitative indicators. A few more concrete guidelines are offered: transnational aspects, possible conflicts with Treaty requirements and clear benefits by reason of scale or effect. p. 134 This understanding of subsidiarity is a long way from the orginal more general mandate of seeking the appropriate 'where' of regulation across all layers of rule-making (not just Community vs national) p. 135 \"The Commission was requested to report once a year on the implementation of the s&p principles in the drafting process of its legislative proposals\" Cie promised to review all proposals and even declared to abandon several because of subsidiarity objections. p. 136 The authors accuse the Cie of abandoning some proposals deemed to be of lesser importance just to show its commitment to subsidiarity, \"while keeping alive the momentum for proposals it considered strategic, regardless of the proposal's impact on subsidiarity\" (eg. the withdrawal of proposed directives for harmonization of frequencies for commercial aircraft and train telephony; their withdrawal allegedly helped pass the strategically more important draft directives opening national telecom markets - \"an issue much cloder to subsidiarity\"). \"(...)the Cie further downplayed its role of seizing the 'where' (...) by reporting that two out of three proposals for new Community legislation are suggested by other Community institutions. p. 137 \"(...) in addition, it has recently combined the issue of 'where' to regulate - s and p - with the issue of 'how' to regulate.\" Prime evidence: the 'Reports on the Application of the Principle of Subsidiarity' (eg COM (93) 545 and COM (94) 533) have been expanded to include legislative quality and was renamed 'Better Lawmaking'. These newer reports do still talk about subsidiarity but mainly about what it does not mean and where it does not apply. \"This blending together of subsidiarity and the more process-oriented issue of legislative quality further dilutes any residual prominence subsidiarity might have had.\" (...) \"A much foggier concept of 'better lawmaking' - an ecclectic mix of issues on 'where' and 'how' to regulate - has taken its place in the official debate\". The authors go on to ask the question why Europe has let this happen. p. 138 'procedural' subsidiarity (de B\u00farca 1999), a more viable variant of subsidiarity that has been embodied by the Community Treaties from the start.[is she really saying this? AM] p. 139 \"By employing legislative methods with such a 'built-in' subsidiarity, the Community has, over time, incorporated the principle of subsidiarity in its law-making process. In stark contrast to 'executive' subsidiarity - the main principle enshrined in Art. 5 TEC - the procedural strand does not exclusively distribute regulatory authority. Instead, authority is shared between the Community and the national law-making bodies.\" 141: The outcome of executive subsidiarity has been meagre. But procedural subsidiarity is promising, because it plays down the exclusivity of the 'where' question, but also because it is linked with the question of 'how' to regulate. Conclusion: In the US federalism review has had virtually no impact on the regulatory process. No bureacratic actor was willing to pursue a federalism agenda, no political actor was imposing it. In the EU (where one might expect subsidiarity to have stronger political backing) the Cie has not energetically pursued subsidiarity, \"and external pressures on it to so do have now subsided.  \"In contrast institutional processes addressing the 'how' dimension have found in a much more natural home in both the US and the EU.\"EU: procedures to implement subsidiarity have gradually evolved into processes addressing the 'how' dimension.

Nevertheless, some N-body simulations and (182)Hf-(182)W and (87)Rb-(87)Sr chronology of some lunar rocks have been used to argue for a later formation of the Moon at 52 to > 100 Myr. This discrepancy is often explained by metal-silicate disequilibrium during giant impacts. Here we describe a model of the (182)W isotopic evolution of the accreting Earth, including constraints from partitioning of refractory siderophile elements (Ni, Co, W, V, and Nb) during core formation, which can explain the discrepancy. Our modeling shows that the concentrations of the siderophile elements of the mantle are consistent with high-pressure metal-silicate equilibration in a terrestrial magma ocean. Our analysis shows that the timing of the MGI is inversely correlated with the time scale of the main accretion stage of the Earth. Specifically, the earliest time the MGI could have taken place right at approximately 30 Myr, corresponds to the end of main-stage accretion at approximately 30 Myr. A late MGI (> 52 Myr) requires the main stage of the Earth's accretion to be completed rapidly in < 10.7 \u00b1 2.5 Myr.

If the Moon was formed during the Earth's accretion, a subsequent accretion of residual heliocentric planetesimals onto the protoearth and the protomoon must have occurred. In this co-accretion stage, a significant amount of lunar-impact-ejecta would be ejected to circumterrestrial orbits, since the mean impact velocity of the planetesimals with the protomoon is much larger than the escape velocity of the protomoon. Orbital calculations of test particles ejected from the protomoon, whose semimajor axis is smaller than that of the present Moon, reveal that most of the particles escaping from the protomoon also escape from the Hill sphere of the protoearth and reduce the planetocentric angular momentum of the primordial Earth-Moon system. Using the results of the ejecta. simulations, we investigate the evolution of the mass ratio and the total angular momentum (Earth's spin angular momentum + Moon's orbital angular momentum) of the Earth-Moon system during the co-accretion. We find that the mass of the protomoon is almost constant or rather decreases and the total angular momentum decreases significantly, if the random velocity of planetesimals is as large as the escape velocity of the protoearth. On the other hand, if the random velocity is the half of the escape velocity of the protoearth, the mass ratio is kept to be almost as large as the present value and the decrease of the total angular momentum is not so significant. Comparing with the results of giant impact simulations, we find that the mass of the protoearth immediately after the Moon-forming impact was 0.7-0.8 times the present value if the impactor-to-target mass ratio was 3 : 7, whereas the giant impact occurred almost in the end of the Earth's accretion if the impactor-to-target mass ratio was 1 : 9. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The model makes clear the physically relevant processes, and allows a physical picture to naturally develop.

We present the results of N-body simulations which examine the effect such gas giant planet migration has on the formation of terrestrial planets. The models incorporate a 0.5 Jupiter mass planet undergoing type II migration through an inner protoplanet-planetesimal disk, with gas drag included. Each model is initiated with the inner disk being at successively increased levels of maturity, so that it is undergoing either oligarchic or giant impact style growth as the gas giant migrates. In all cases, a large fraction of the disk mass survives the passage of the giant, either by accreting into massive terrestrial planets shepherded inward of the giant, or by being scattered into external orbits. Shepherding is favored in younger disks where there is strong dynamical friction from planetesimals and gas drag is more influential, whereas scattering dominates in more mature disks where dissipation is weaker. In each scenario, sufficient mass is scattered outward to provide for the eventual accretion of a set of terrestrial planets in external orbits, including within the system's habitable zone. This scattering, however, significantly reduces the density of solid material, indicating that further accretion will occur over very long time scales. A particularly interesting result is the generation of massive, short period, terrestrial planets from compacted material pushed ahead of the giant. These planets are reminiscent of the short period Neptune-mass planets discovered recently, suggesting that such ``hot Neptunes'' could form locally as a by-product of giant planet migration. - astrobiology", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-26244432361", "issn": "1432-0746", "isbn": "0004-6361", "arxiv": "astro-ph/0507180", "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361:20053453"}, "source": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "authors": [{"first_name": "M J", "last_name": "Fogg"}, {"first_name": "R P", "last_name": "Nelson"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/oligarchic-giant-impact-growth-terrestrial-planets-presence-gas-giant-planet-migration", "year": 2005, "keywords": ["methods: N-body simulations", "planets and satellites: formation"], "type": "journal", "id": "17ad86c7-4ed5-3ef6-b997-318fb9f32f16"}, {"title": "Oxygen isotopes and the moon-forming giant impact.", "abstract": "We have determined the abundances of 16O, 17O, and 18O in 31 lunar samples from Apollo missions 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17 using a high-precision laser fluorination technique.

Here we propose an explanation for the two timescales. We suggest that the Hf-W timescale reflects the principal phase of core-formation before the giant impact. Crystallization of silicate perovskite in the lower mantle during this phase produced Fe(3+), which was released during the giant impact, and this oxidation resulted in late segregation of sulphur-rich metal into which Pb dissolved readily, setting the younger U-Pb age of the Earth. Separation of the latter metal then occurred 30 +/- 10 Myr after the Moon-forming impact. Over this time span, in surprising agreement with Kelvin's result, the Earth cooled by about 4,000 K in returning from a fully molten to a partially crystalline state.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-27644476265", "pmid": "16251962", "issn": "0028-0836", "isbn": "1476-4687 (Electronic)\\r0028-0836 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1038/nature04129"}, "source": "Nature", "authors": [{"first_name": "Bernard J.", "last_name": "Wood"}, {"first_name": "Alex N.", "last_name": "Halliday"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/cooling-earth-core-formation-after-giant-impact", "year": 2005, "type": "journal", "id": "69439f69-9c51-350b-ba64-2697083f0702"}, {"title": "On the origin and composition of Theia: Constraints from new models of the Giant Impact", "abstract": "Knowing the isotopic composition of Theia, the proto-planet which collided with the Earth in the Giant Impact that formed the Moon, could provide interesting insights on the state of homogenization of the inner Solar System at the late stages of terrestrial planet formation.

The regeneration of the nation was to be effected by teaching the masses to exercise their reason through the study of the sciences and Kantian rationalist morality. Through learning this universally shared 'independent morality,' they would become free citizens capable of exercising sovereignty over themselves and the democratic nation, rising above the constraints of natural determinism. The rhetoric of saving the homeland (patrie) from 'anarchy' through regeneration thus dovetailed perfectly with the logic of rational universalism. But in order to have a real effect on the children of scarcely literate peasants and workers, the new curriculum was designed to subjectify the relation of the pupils to the republican State. To moral education, the Opportunists added a civic instruction whose goal was to inspire the children's respect, gratitude, and obedience toward the Republic by depicting it as their mother. The rhetoric of regeneration here was a metaphorical process of transference in which the natural mother was replaced by the national mother of the patrie.

Proceeding within an interdisciplinary analytical framework, it traces the efforts of the Touring Club de France and its allies in the emerging French tourist \"industry\" to reorganize tourism as an encounter with the authentic, based in particular experiences of the French past, of movement and space, nature and locality, seeing, and the body. Newly-informed by solidarist-nationalist principle and by subtle shifts in the center of gravity within the French bourgeoisie, the tourism of this period constituted a \"France\", as the sum of its natural, historic and cultural attractions, all of which were now available for consumption by national and international middle class tourists.   These promises of access to the authentic--so essential to tourism's appeal and significance as a modern cultural and social activity, as Dean MacCannel an others have argued--proved deeply accommodating of the broadly-felt desire in this period to get at French national identity, the \"real\" or \"true\" France that lay beyond its differences. Tourism's new advocates presented it as a medium for generating symbols of nationhood, deepening national consciousness and nurturing love of nation. Putting more of the nation in display--the stated aim of French tourist organizers in this period--responded simultaneously to the imperative of imagining and building republican nationhood, as well as to needs more specific to the French and international middle classes for updated markers of status distinction.   The commodified France available in tourism emerged as a high quality good, a combination of authentic traditional cultures, a certain quality of experience, and a ready connection to a seemingly vanishing past. For the French themselves, therefore, tourist consumption served the end of confirming the bourgeoisie in its status as a preeminently national class, the sole class with access to the most fundamental symbols of national belonging. The capacity of the bourgeois to access national symbols and traditions, and maintain him or herself in a certain relationship to them, was essential to the claim to most profoundly embody the broad aspirations of French nationhood, at a time of particularly acute class conflict and national ralliement . Yet, for international travelers as well, tourism in France had the function of confirming and transmitting an essential \"Frenchness\", one which conferred cultural and social distinction upon its consumers.", "identifiers": {"isbn": "9780599594555; 0599594551"}, "source": "ProQuest Dissertations and Theses", "authors": [{"first_name": "Patrick Robert", "last_name": "Young"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/consumer-national-subject-bourgeois-tourism-french-third-republic-18801914", "year": 2000, "keywords": ["0335:European history", "0814:Recreation", "Bourgeois", "Consumer", "European history", "French", "National subject", "Recreation", "Social sciences", "Third Republic", "Tourism"], "type": "thesis", "id": "6056b728-dfe5-3af6-9c32-d5de164eb566"}, {"title": "Primary Education in Third Republic France: Recent French Works", "abstract": "ArticleType: book-review / Full publication date: Summer, 1986 / Copyright \u00a9 1986 History of Education Society", "identifiers": {"issn": "00182680", "doi": "10.2307/368743"}, "source": "History of Education Quarterly", "authors": [{"first_name": "Barry H.", "last_name": "Bergen"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/primary-education-third-republic-france-recent-french-works", "year": 1986, "type": "journal", "id": "d0b9fbcf-3657-3560-9947-e459cb028b0c"}, {"title": "Are Animals Just Noisy Machines?: Louis Boutan and the Co-invention of Animal and Child Psychology in the French Third Republic", "abstract": "Historians of science have only just begun to sample the wealth of different approaches to the study of animal behavior undertaken in the twentieth century. To date, more attention has been given to Lorenzian ethology and American behaviorism than to other work and traditions, but different approaches are equally worthy of the historian's attention, reflecting not only the broader range of questions that could be asked about animal behavior and the \"animal mind\" but also the different contexts in which these questions were important. One such approach is that represented by the work of the French zoologist Louis Boutan (1859-1934). This paper explores the intellectual and cultural history of Boutan's work on animal language and the animal mind, and contextualizes the place of animal behavior studies within late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century French biology. I explore the ways in which Boutan addressed the philosophical issue of whether language was necessary for abstract thought and show how he shifted from the idea that animals were endowed with a purely affective language to the notion that of they were capable of \"rudimentary\" reasoning. I argue that the scientific and broader socio-cultural contexts in which Boutan operated played a role in this transition. Then I show how Boutan's linguistic and psychological experiments with a gibbon and children provide insights into his conception of \"naturalness.\" Although Boutan reared his gibbon at home and studied it in the controlled environment of his laboratory, he continued to identify its behavior as \"natural.\" I specifically demonstrate the importance of the milieu of the French Third Republic in shaping Boutan's understanding not only of animal intelligence and child education, but also his definition of nature. Finally, I argue that Boutan's studies on the primate mind provide us with a lens through which we can examine the co-invention of animal and child psychology in early-twentieth-century France.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-28944433351", "pmid": "17153426", "issn": "0022-5010", "isbn": "0022-5010 (Print)\\r0022-5010 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1007/s10739-005-0555-y"}, "source": "Journal of the History of Biology", "authors": [{"first_name": "Marion", "last_name": "Thomas"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/animals-just-noisy-machines-louis-boutan-coinvention-animal-child-psychology-french-third-republic", "year": 2005, "keywords": ["animal language", "animal mind", "boutan", "child psychology", "ethology", "french"], "type": "journal", "id": "9da890f8-c308-3586-b06f-03a4103ddafb"}, {"title": "France - History and Story", "abstract": "Presents highlights from the national conference entitled 'France: History and Story' held at the University of Birmingham in July 1999.

In that sense, and to the extent that it pretends to be a third force in world politics, France claims to be truly non aligned and, consequently, presents itself as the 'natural ally\" of the Third World.  103 It is such a polica of 'balkanisaiton' that France has succesfully carried out in Africa.  In effect, the two notions of independence and co-operation are intimately associated.  104 Indeed France has, on several occasions, shown a deep suspicion of the motives and actions of theses powers in Africa.   105 Although Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand had proclaimed his desire and willingness to somewhat 'liberalise' his policy, his Socialist regime (inaugurated in 1981) found its room of manoeuvre strictly limited by 'historical' constraints and by the weight of economic, political, and strategic interests. Mitterrand was thus led to manager, rather than to radically transform, this inheritance.    108 The two main French aid agencies, the Fonds d'Aide et de Coop\u00e9ration (FAC) and the Caisse Centrale de Coop\u00e9ration \u00c9conomique (CCCE) are, in fact, acting as conduits for the transfer of French public capital to the beneficiary African state agencies, and from the latter to the French firms operating in those countries. Indeed, the 'rate of return' of FAC and CCCE aid is generally estimated at between 97 and 80 per cent.  111 decision making in African affairs is based on a complex and elaborate information network, initiated by Jacques Foccart, de Gaulle's adviser on African affairs, in which personal relations and the intervention of officialor unofficial 'special action' agencies play a prominent role. As for specialisation, relations with Francophone African states since independence have always been the responsability of a special ministry, the Ministry of Cooperation.  113 The neo-colonial systen thus set up actually results in a de facto alliance between the French and the African ruling elites, each defending the interest of the other to the detriment of those of the indigenous people.  Since independence, France has concluded a number of defence and military technical assistance agreements with each of its former African colonies. These have been renegotiated in the mid-1970s without significant changes, and they have been extended to African countries situated outside the traditional French zone of influence, notably to Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire.

It was the purpose of this study to analyze the distribution of force transmitted to the alveolus and surrounding structures by means of photoelastic visualization, utilizing J hook headgear for maxillary canine retraction. A three-dimensional model representing a human skull was used. This model was constructed with different birefringent materials to simulate bone, teeth, and periodontal membranes. Three different vectors of force were applied representing high-, medium-, and low-pull headgear, which were placed at angles of 40, 20, and 0 degrees to the occlusal plane. The photoelastic analysis was made by means of a circular-transmission polariscope arrangement, and the photoelastic data were recorded photographically. The stress areas created by the three different vectors of force were associated with various degrees of canine tipping. This effect was greater with the low-pull force component than with the medium-pull traction. The high-pull headgear produced the least tipping tendency, being closer to a bodily movemment effect.

She and seven other CEOs, among them the heads of American Express, Johnson & Johnson, U.S. Steel, and Wells Fargo, were placed like pegs in a tightly designed game board, sitting in front of tent cards with their names in a formal script, waiting for the President to arrive. At the President's place sat a folio of notes and a small box with a red button. Burns, who had been seated in a position of honor to Obama's right, was to be the last to speak. As she waited, she considered whether the button could be the executive branch equivalent of The Gong Show gong. She thought to herself: Maybe he pushes it if he doesn't like what we say. When it was her turn, Burns recalls, the President said, \"'This has been really good, and now I'm bracing for the tough one.''' Burns smiles at the recollection. She is known to be tough. Burns is the first African-American woman to lead a company the size of Xerox, coming to power in 2009 during an economic tailspin that continues to threaten the global economy and her company's bottom line. She is the second woman to run the iconic firm, in a historic succession that has produced historic results: Working closely with friend and former CEO Anne Mulcahy, Burns was part of a small group of executives who rescued Xerox from near bankruptcy in 2001 and began moving the company away from its machine-making roots and into a different business entirely. \"The thing I valued most about Ursula, and why I valued her participation in senior management, is that she has the courage to tell you the truth in ugly times,\" says Mulcahy.", "year": 2011, "source": "Fast Company Magazine", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/fresh-copy-ursula-burns-reinvented-xerox", "authors": [{"first_name": "Fast Company", "last_name": "Staff"}], "id": "fa15b4df-edb4-3de1-8dbd-d8ecca01ab28"}, {"title": "The Hydroforming Process", "abstract": "Hydroforming was developed in the late 1940's and early 1950's to provide a cost effective means to produce relatively small quantities of drawn parts or parts with asymmetrical or irregular contours that do not lend themselves to stamping.

Attitudes, beliefs and behaviour related to sexual and injecting drug practices, with a view to assess the need for introduction of screening program for the new entrants of the armed forces was also studied. Methods: A multi-centric cross sectional serological and behavioural survey was carried out amongst newly enrolled trainees of the Armed Forces in 2004. The group was selected by multistage random sampling giving equal representation to all regions of India. Study subjects were interviewed using a pretested, validated questionnaire and screened for HIV, HBV and HCV infections by rapid tests. Standard confirmatory tests were carried out for trainees testing positive. Quality assurance measures were integral part of each activity. A database was created in MS Access and SPSS ver 11.0.1 was used for analysis. Result: Out of the 23,000 trainees included in the study, 22666 (98.55%) were included in the analysis . The age, formal education and age at first sexual intercourse of participants ranged from 16\u201325 years (median 20), 8\u201317 years (median 10) and 12\u201325 years, respectively.

What has been observed since Sept' 20 is what was predict-ed by scholarly research: a strong similarity between the U.S. experience and those of allied militaries that had repealed their gay exclusion policies over the previous two decades, including Australia, Britain, Canada, Israel and South Africa. As the latest empirical evidence is now beginning to show, the repeal of DADT has been nothing but a positive story largely because it has been no story at all. CUTN'RAL CHAI{GE Until the late 1980s, U.S. society believed good reasons exist-ed for excluding gays from the military, and consequently, during the ColdWar, the U.S. govemment expressed little interest in re-examining its exclusionary gay policy. Public attitudes toward homosemality placed minimal external pressure on the military to change because it was merely assumed that the exclusion policywas in the military's best interests, and by extension, in the best interest of the public. But away from the public eye, the military was suppressing evidence that the presence of gays in its ranks likely had no impact on its ability to go about its business.

Listen! And bear in mind that if you do so, through spite or through covetousness, not only will your goods be confiscated, but your bodies also placed in mortal danger. \u2013 Albrecht D\u00fcrer This may well be the most belligerent copyright notice ever penned. It appeared in the colophon to an engraving series called Life of the Virgin\u00b8 published in Nuremberg in 1511. Its author and the creator of the engravings, the great painter and printmaker Albrecht D\u00fcrer, had good reason to fear forgers. Five years earlier, D\u00fcrer had received one of his prints from the original 1502 Life of the Virgin series, sent to him from Venice by a concerned friend. D\u00fcrer\u2019s prints were wildly popular throughout Europe, considered highly collectible and yet a more affordable alternative to commissioning an original painting. D\u00fcrer cultivated his status as a celebrity artist, one whose name alone, associated with a print or painting, would raise its value. He was perhaps the first internationally self-promoting artist in history, more akin to a Jeff Koons or Damien Hirst, from a publicity standpoint, rather than the solitary, morose likes of his contemporaries, such as Giorgione or Pontormo. He even created what some consider the first artist\u2019s trademark: a stylized monogram signature featuring a small upper-case letter \u201cD\u201d between the legs of a large upper-case letter \u201cA.\u201d The authenticity of D\u00fcrer\u2019s prints was assured by the inclusion of this famed monogram-cum-signature. In 1506, in his Nuremberg studio, surrounded by pots of pigment, coal to make ink, quill pens and vellum pages, wood for stretchers stacked in a corner, and everywhere the smell of sweat, leather, and varnish, D\u00fcrer examined the woodcut engraving from his Life of the Virgin series. He discovered that it was nearly identical \u2013 but it was not his handiwork. It was the work of a master forger. D\u00fcrer surely rolled his eyes, muttered curses under his breath, and let out a long sigh. D\u00fcrer\u2019s name, monogram, and prints were of such renown throughout Europe that, as early as 1494, at least six different printmakers were producing copies of D\u00fcrer prints and selling them as originals. D\u00fcrer was determined to fight to protect his name and his work from piracy. He would bring what might be considered the first Intellectual Properties lawsuits\u2014first against a madman in his native Nuremberg, who was doodling nonsense onto canvas and selling his doodles in front of the town hall as D\u00fcrer paintings; and then, in 1506, when a more serious case was held in Venice. One of D\u00fcrer\u2019s friends had sent him one of these fraudulent woodcut prints from Venice, where it had been published by a family of printers by the name of Dal Jesus. A quick investigation led to the artist behind the copies, a master print-maker (and sometime pornographer) called Marcantonio Raimondi. Raimondi was already an established print-maker, having been contracted to reproduce (legally) prints of Raphael\u2019s most famous paintings. These inexpensive, portable prints allowed Raphael\u2019s art to be seen in the far reaches of Europe by those who were unable to travel to Rome or Urbino, and spread his influence widely. Raimondi was also notorious for having illustrated a pornographic book called I Modi (roughly translated as \u201cthe positions\u201d), a sort of sexual manual with text by the notorious and wickedly witty Pietro Aretino. To give a sense of Aretino\u2019s humor, the Venetian playwright and general wit is said to have died of a stroke induced from laughing too hard at a dirty joke made at the expense of his sister. The unquestionably skillful Raimondi had purchased original D\u00fcrer prints while in Venice in 1506. From these he created woodcut plates from scratch, including the famous \u201cAD\u201d monogram signature. The Dal Jesus family used these plates to produce prints which were then sold as D\u00fcrer originals. But the case was far from straight-forward, for while Raimondi had copied every detail of D\u00fcrer\u2019s incredibly intricate prints (a work of miraculous and admirable skill on the part of the forger), he had included three alterations to the original design which distinguished his creations as copies\u2014and which would eventually be used as an escape clause to get him off the hook. Raimondi included his own monogram, an intertwined \u201cMAF\u201d inspired by D\u00fcrer\u2019s trademark. He also added the device of the Dal Jesus publishing house, the \u201cYHS\u201d of Christ placed inside a squared quatrefoil. Finally, Raimondi included two triangles arranged in the shape of an hourglass, which were included in the sign on the Dal Jesus print shop. It took close examination to notice these additions, but they were there. They raised the question as to whether Raimondi himself intended these prints to be passed off as D\u00fcrer originals, or if he merely intended to make an homage after D\u00fcrer. It may have been that the Dal Jesus family firm, without Raimondi\u2019s complicity, sought to increase its revenues by selling these prints as originals\u2014for a D\u00fcrer would fetch many times the price of a Raimondi copy after D\u00fcrer. The dynamic and ingenious Albrecht D\u00fcrer had had quite enough of forgers profiting from his work. He brought a lawsuit against Raimondi and the Dal Jesus family in Venice, in an effort to prevent the Dal Jesus printers from publishing and selling more of these copies. He thought that this might set an example and dissuade future forgers. The suit proved only partially successful. The Venetian authorities declared that because Raimondi had hand-carved the engraving plates, and because he made three subtle alterations to the original design, the prints were not exact copies, but merely excellent imitations. Raimondi should not be blamed for being as skilled an artist as D\u00fcrer, and D\u00fcrer should be flattered that his work was considered important enough to copy. Raimondi was required to remove D\u00fcrer\u2019s signature from the plates, and the Dal Jesus family was forced to sell Raimondi\u2019s versions as explicit copies, revoking the claim that they were D\u00fcrer originals. Had this case been brought to court today in Italy or the United States, Columbia University Law Professor Jane Ginsburg notes that the outcome would be quite different. Contemporary copyright law would see Raimondi\u2019s work as an infringement because it substantially copied the original image, and the inclusion of the AD monogram would be considered \u201cpassing off\u201d copies as originals, thereby violating trademark law. But in 1506, in the first known case of art-specific intellectual property law brought to trial, D\u00fcrer would not receive complete satisfaction. D\u00fcrer stormed off back to Nuremberg, unhappy with the result. He had heard the argument before, that he should be flattered that his work was so famous as to draw copyists\u2014but the last time he had heard it, it related to the crazy old man selling doodles \u201cby D\u00fcrer\u201d outside the Nuremberg town hall. When he came to publish his 1511 edition of The Life of the Virgin, D\u00fcrer was careful to include his vituperative copyright warning. * The history of forgery is filled with such entertaining, but likewise informative, anecdotes that are still relevant today. Arguments over brand-name authenticity, copyright and trademark are staples of contemporary intellectual properties law. That the origins of artistic copyright law date back to a legal brawl between one of history\u2019s first self-promoting celebrity artists and a renegade Venetian pornographic print-maker turned forger does not detract from its contemporary application. Art has been copied, misattributed and forged since long before the Biblical era. Indeed, the authenticity of artworks was already a concern in ancient Rome, where Greek vases and sculptures were prized above Roman copies of them. In the Middle Ages a lively trade in fake religious relics flourished along pilgrimage trails, as we will see when we discuss the Shroud of Turin. The history of art forgery is as old as the art trade. What fascinates people about forgery? In any given case we find an intriguing amalgam of the desire for fame, money, revenge, and the expression of genius. The renowned art forger Eric Hebborn had his original works dismissed by the art community, which considered him talentless. To make matters worse, when Hebborn found what he thought was an original Old Master drawing at a car boot sale and brought it to the storied Colnaghi Gallery, they bought it for him for a lowly sum, saying that it was of little value. When Hebborn walked past Colnaghi the following week, he was enraged to see that very drawing in the window, priced at ten times what he had been paid. Revenge against first Colnaghi, and then the art world collectively, prompted Hebborn to introduce some of his own attempts at \u201cOld Master drawings\u201d into the art market. The wealth that he would accumulate by selling forged Old Masters was the icing on the cake, with revenge as his primary motivation. That revenge might never have become a public one had Hebborn not blown his own cover, with enthusiasm. When his career had run its course, his own abilities and genius proven (at least to his personal, private satisfaction) at the expense of art experts who mistook his drawings for", "authors": [{"first_name": "Noah", "last_name": "Charney"}], "source": "Book", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/book-forgery", "year": 2014, "type": "book", "id": "f28c4ebe-0314-3e50-ba11-3913d246d6b3"}, {"title": "Book reviews.", "abstract": "Food in the AncientWorld describes foods produced and con- sumed from the beginnings of Egyptian Predynastic (4000 B.C.E.) to the end of the Roman Empire (C.E. fifth century), focusing on four civilizations: the Egyptians, Greeks, Celts, and Romans.

During the war, Germany--and, later, the Allies--plundered Europe's historic treasures. Between 1939 and 1945, German armed forces roamed from Dunkirk to Stalingrad, looting gold, silver, currency, paintings and other works of art, coins, religious artifacts, and millions of books and other documents. The value of these items, many of which were irreplaceable, is estimated in the billions of dollars.

He shows how Nazi tactics, including the systematic taking and killing of hostages, reprisal killings, and the destruction of entire villages, complicated the attempts of the Resistance to fight back. He also includes a detailed discussion of the controversial role of the Jewish police. Under the Shadow of the Swastika analyzes morally questionable methods of resistance, such as torture, the mutilation and killing of German prisoners of war, and guerrilla warfare.

In 1996, Farmer was awarded the \"Bundesverdienstkreuz\" for his outstanding work. Besides being a personal account, this autobiography presents an important document of present-day history. It is completed by an extensive list of documents and archive material.Item discusses life at the Wiesbaden Collecting Point in Germany, where cultural property and art works were collected and held at the end World War II. In November 1945 the Director of the Collection Point (the author) received a telegram ordering him to send 200 premier German-owned art works to Washington.

But such books leave us wondering: What made thoughtful, educated, artistic men and women decide to put their talents in the service of a brutal and inhuman regime? This question is the starting point for The Faustian Bargain, Jonathan Petropoulos's study of the key figures in the art world of Nazi Germany. Petropoulos follows the careers of these prominent individuals who like Faust, that German archetype, chose to pursue artistic ends through collaboration with diabolical forces. Readers meet Ernst Buchner, the distinguished museum director and expert on Old Master paintings who \"repatriated\" the Van Eyck brothers' Ghent altarpiece to Germany, and Karl Haberstock, an art dealer who filled German museums with works bought virtually at gunpoint from Jewish collectors. Robert Scholz, the leading art critic in the Third Reich, who became an officer in the chief art looting unit in France and Kajetan Muhlmann-and a leading art historian-was probably the single most prolific art plunderer in the war (and arguably in history). Finally, there is Arno Breker, a gifted artist who exchanged his modernist style for monumental realism and became Hitler's favorite sculptor. If it is striking that these educated men became part of the Nazi machine, it is more remarkable that most of them rehabilitated their careers and lived comfortably after the war. Petropoulos has discovered a network of these rehabilitated experts that flourished in the postwar period, and he argues that this is a key to the tens of thousands of looted artworks that are still \"missing\" today. Based on previously unreleased information and recently declassified documents, The Faustian Bargain is a gripping read about the art world during this period, and a fascinating examination of the intense relationship between culture and politics in the Third Reich.", "identifiers": {"issn": "0022-2801", "isbn": "0195129644 9780195129649", "doi": "10.1086/377792"}, "source": "Book", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jonathan.", "last_name": "Petropoulos"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/faustian-bargain-art-world-nazi-germany", "year": 2003, "keywords": ["D History General and Old World"], "type": "book", "id": "dbb029da-e31a-30e0-bb8e-dadee8ffa779"}, {"title": "Plant Engineer's Reference Book", "abstract": "Over the years there have been great strides made in harnessing the power that wind carries.

It focuses on bilateral and multilateral development agencies. Since the first compilation exercise was carried out in 2001, the ICT for development landscape has changed in a number of ways that are well reflected in the survey findings, including: * most donors have now developed a strategy not only to use ICT for development within their existing and new programmes but also to integrate ICT within their own agencies to improve the way they deliver their development programmes * strategies are shaped by long-term experience in the field of ICT for development, pilot projects or by in-depth studies. They are guided by the needs of developing countries, particularly the priorities identified in the Millennium Declaration * ICTs are considered in the broad sense, encompassing both traditional, old technologies (radio, television) and high technologies (Internet, mobile phones) and some donors emphasise the interest of combining both new and old technologies to maximise benefits * ICTs are in most cases seen as tools to help meet development objectives and not as a separate sector. Some donors also underline the need to create an enabling environment as a prerequisite for effective and efficient use of ICTs as tools for development. For those donors, investment in telecommunications infrastructure and the creation of the necessary technological, legal, regulatory and human framework remains a priority * in all cases, donors put ICT to the service of the achievement of their broader strategic objectives. The focus is on meeting objectives not on technology per se * donors\u2019 guiding principles for use of ICT for development emphasise respect for national ownership and that support should be demand-driven, encouraging and assisting developing country governments to formulate their own ICT development strategies. When developing countries decide to harness ICT for development, some donors recommend that those developing country governments include their ICT for development strategy in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) * most donors have built their ICT for development strategy on partnerships involving a number of actors from other bilateral and multilateral agencies, ministries (communications, education\u2026), civil society, the private sector, universities and research institutions The difficulty in identifying or quantifying the ICT component of projects might be the clearest demonstration that most donors have indeed mainstreamed ICT in their development programmes. However, it is estimated that: * there has not been a significant increase in funding for ICT since 2001 * that the amount directly for ICT, including to the telecommunications sector, remains well short of $1 billion", "authors": [{"last_name": "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD]"}], "source": "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] Development Co-operation Directorate [DCD]", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/donor-information-communication-technology-ict-strategies-summary-matrix", "year": 2003, "type": "journal", "id": "88fd1813-f631-32c6-8021-5b87d3d65638"}, {"title": "A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire Cambridge Studies in Islamic Civilization", "abstract": "The Ottoman empire stood at the crossroads of intercontinental trade at the dawn of the era of capitalism.

Whether in the paintings of Otto Dix and George Grosz, in post-war novels such as All Quiet on the Western Front , or in his uniform begging on a busy Berlin street, the wounded World War I veteran was a commonplace in interwar Germany. In addition to his impact on interwar culture, however, the disabled veteran also seriously threatened the nation's welfare system. During the war, unprecedented numbers of casualties contributed directly to a wartime manpower crisis in the German Empire; however, the long-term care and welfare of these permanently disabled soldiers also loomed ominously before the state's national and military pension systems.                 This dissertation outlines the medical treatment and social welfare for Germany's severely wounded soldiers. The relentless slaughter of the First World War encouraged orthopaedists to re-evaluate the direction of their field and ultimately re-orient their professional goals toward rehabilitating, that is, healing and restoring, the injured body, not simply saving the wounded's life. To this end, rather than simply leaving the fate of the disabled soldier to the military and/or national pension system, German orthopaedists developed a complex program of physical rehabilitation, social re-integration, and job placement in order to return these men to what they considered to be a \"productive economic life.\"                 Moreover, this reorientation of German orthopaedics towards restoring economic self-sufficiency to the disabled marked an important shift in medical ideas about the body and the perception of injury, a shift which I am calling, \"the cultural invention of disability.\" This invention of disability necessitated the development of medical rehabilitation, hundreds of artificial limbs, training programs, and a public re-educational campaign. Through close readings of the devices and programs they crafted, I show how rehabilitation was fundamentally influenced not only by class and political ideology, but also the war-time labor needs of the state. Finally, I demonstrate how orthopaedists's allegiance to corporeal functionalism was not only necessary in their struggle for professionalization, but was equally reflective of the increasingly important role of medicine in the total mobilization of German society for war.", "identifiers": {"isbn": "9780542248672; 0542248670"}, "source": "ProQuest Dissertations and Theses", "authors": [{"first_name": "Heather R", "last_name": "Perry"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/recycling-disabled-army-medicine-society-world-war-i-germany", "year": 2005, "keywords": ["0335:European history", "Army", "Disabled", "European history", "Germany", "Medicine", "Social sciences", "Society", "World War I"], "type": "thesis", "id": "308fb47e-0260-38eb-aefd-7c98b0838de2"}, {"title": "Higher Education in Regional and City Development: B\u00a9\u01afo B\u00a9\u01afo Region, Chile 2010", "abstract": "The B\u00edo B\u00edo Region has pioneered regional development in Chile.

The plan was based on the idea that Franco-Russian rapprochement made a German two-front war inevitable. Schlieffen's successor, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger (1906-14), firmly committed himself to the plan. Thus Germany's declaration of war on Russia (August 1, 1914), a response to Russian mobilization, was followed immediately by its declaration of war on France (August 3). On August 4, Britain, the third member of the Triple Entente, declared war on Germany. In 1915 Italy, which had been allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary, switched allegiance and joined the Triple Entente powers. The strategy of the Schlieffen Plan conceived a swift victory in the west in which German troops entering France via neutral Belgium and the Netherlands would envelop the French armies, pinning them against the Swiss border. The bulk of the German army would then be free for combat in the east. The plan failed, however, leaving German troops stalemated in trench warfare in France. As a result, Moltke, who had at first altered the Schlieffen Plan and later abandoned it, was relieved of his executive position in September 1914 and was succeeded by Erich von Falkenhayn. Conflict raged between Falkenhayn, who insisted on continued efforts in the west, and the eastern command of Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff, who had achieved significant advances. Bethmann-Hollweg's September Program of 1914 set forth Germany's war aims, which included an expanded Germany (Mitteleuropa) with Belgium and Poland as vassal states and German colonies in Africa. The program reflected a domestic political climate in which the German nation had been virtually unanimous in supporting the decision to go to war; in August 1914, even the Social Democrats voted in favor of war credits in the Reichstag. During the first years of the war, the Reichstag was controlled by the Kriegszielmehrheit (war aims majority), a parliamentary bloc including delegates from the National Liberal Party, Center Party, and Conservative Party. The Kriegszielmehrheit had pressed for an annexationist war aims program; influential German interest groups, such as the Pan-German League, the army and navy, agrarian and industrial associations, and the intelligentsia approved. The SPD alone remained adamantly opposed to all annexationist claims. By the spring of 1915, the war of movement envisioned by the Schlieffen Plan had become a war of position, and political and social disagreements, temporarily forgotten during the upsurge of patriotic feeling, began to reappear. By late summer 1916, chances for a definitive German victory seemed remote, and consequently Bethmann-Hollweg considered peace negotiations. His peace note, however, was rejected by the Triple Entente powers. After the offer to negotiate was rejected, the Army High Command, headed by Chief of Staff Hindenburg and his adjutant general, Ludendorff, demanded passage of the Auxiliary Service Bill calling for the large-scale militarization of Germany; the Reichstag passed a considerably weakened version of the bill in early 1917. To cripple operations of the Triple Entente by destroying a sufficient amount of shipping, Germany began unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917. In the meantime, although the Army High Command increasingly gained control of political decision making, pressure for a peace settlement mounted in the Reichstag. Bethmann-Hollweg attempted to pacify the opposition in the Reichstag with a renewed pledge of democratic reform; and Wilhelm II, reacting to the first workers' strike in Germany, which had been sparked by the Russian Revolution of February 1917, issued his famous Ostergeschenk (Easter present) confirming his chancellor's promise of reform. The Social Democrats nevertheless proceeded to issue a manifesto demanding peace without annexations. The Army High Command, however, remained committed to war and annexation. In April and May 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff met with Wilhelm II at Kreuznach and persuaded the emperor to draft the Kreuznach claims confirming the goals of the September Program. Bethmann-Hollweg and the Reichstag rejected the Kreuznach claims, however, and in July an interparty Reichstag committee drafted a resolution demanding peace without annexations. Hindenburg and Ludendorff expressed their opposition by resigning their posts. Wilhelm, compelled to choose between Bethmann-Hollweg and the Army High Command, supported Hindenburg and Ludendorff and demanded the chancellor's resignation. Thus Hindenburg and Ludendorff gained de facto control of political decision making. After the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917, Russia and Germany began peace negotiations. In March 1918, the two countries signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The defeat of Russia enabled Germany to transfer troops from the eastern to the western front. This advantage was by far outweighed, however, by the United States declaration of war against Germany in April 1917, provoked largely by Germany's continued unrestricted submarine warfare. In order to break the French and British lines before the arrival of the expeditionary force from the United States, Germany launched a large offensive in March 1918 and succeeded in reaching the Marne River. A second large offensive on July 15, aimed at definitively smashing the enemy, failed, and German troops were subsequently pressed back along their extended front. In the early fall of 1918, the Army High Command conceded and called for an armistice. The armistice, signed on November 11 after the Social Democrats had proclaimed a republic and formed a government, was later repudiated by the military, which, together with the extreme right, created the myth of the \"stab in the back\" that blamed defeat in World War I on left-wing elements. German military casualties in World War I amounted to 1.6 million dead, more than 4 million wounded, and more than 200,000 missing in action. The Treaty of Versailles, which was signed in June 1919, called for German disarmament. As a result of the treaty, the Rhineland was demilitarized and occupied by the western Allied powers for fifteen years; Germany ceded Alsace-Lorraine, the Polish Corridor, northern Schleswig-Holstein, and all overseas colonies; and the Allied Reparations Commission was established and charged with deciding the total war damage payments to be demanded of Germany. The Treaty of Versailles also included the \"war guilt clause,\" which, by its implicit suggestion of German responsibility for World War I, evoked generalized German contempt for the treaty. Historians debate Germany's responsibility for World War I; some claim that Germany's entry into the war was accidental and defensive, others that the war was the result of German imperialism. It remains to be shown, in either case, that Wilhelmine aspirations were indeed qualitatively different from the pre-World War I imperialist ambitions of Britain or France. The Weimar Republic, 1918-1933 Weimar Constitution The Weimar Republic, proclaimed on November 9, 1918, was born in the throes of military defeat and social revolution (see fig. 5). On November 3, mutiny had broken out among naval squadrons stationed at Kiel. Workers had joined the revolt, which had quickly spread to other ports and to cities in northern, central, and southern Germany, finally reaching Berlin on November 9. Largely as a result of the November Revolution, Prince Max von Baden, the German chancellor, announced the abdication of the emperor. Following the abdication, the Social Democrats in the Reichstag gained control of the government; they proclaimed the republic, formed a provisional cabinet, and organized the National Assembly. Another revolt instigated in Berlin by the Spartacus League, a group of left-wing extremists, was crushed by the army in January 1919. In February the National Assembly elected Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert to the presidency and drafted a constitution. The Weimar Constitution of 1919 established a federal republic consisting of nineteen states (L\u00e4nder). The republic was headed by a president who was to be elected by popular direct ballot for a seven-year term and who could be reelected . The president appointed the chancellor and, based on the chancellor's nominations, also appointed the cabinet ministers. He retained authority to dismiss the cabinet, dissolve the Reichstag, and veto legislation. The legislative powers of the Reichstag were further weakened by the provision for presidential recourse to popular plebiscite. Article 48, the so-called emergency clause, accorded the president dictatorial rights to intervene in the territorial states for the purpose of enforcing constitutional and federal laws and/or to restore public order. The constitution provided for the Reichstag and the Reichsrat (council of German states' representatives). The Reichstag, elected by popular suffrage, voted on legislation introduced by the chancellor. By a vote of no confidence, it could call for the dismissal of both chancellor and cabinet ministers. The Reichsrat replaced the Bundesrat (see Political Consolidation , this ch.). Established to guarantee state government supervision of national legislation, it was nevertheless subordinated to national control in that members of the Reichstag cabinet convened and presided over Reichsrat sessions. The Reichstag was empowered to override Reichsrat opposition with a two-thirds majority vote. The powers accorded to the president reflected the nineteenth century's conservative and liberal predilection for monarchical rule. But democratization of suffrage strengthened the Reichstag, and in theory both the military and the bureaucracy were subordinated to cabinet control. Thus the constitution established a republic based", "year": 1987, "source": "East Germany: A Country Study", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/weimar-germany-rise-nazis", "authors": [{"first_name": "Stephen R.", "last_name": "Burant"}], "id": "4a87d7e8-561b-3e00-8b2b-172feea7094d"}, {"title": "Persistence of population shocks: Evidence from the occupation of West Germany after world war II", "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of World War II, millions of German expellees were resettled into the new borders of Germany, but not into the parts of Germany that were occupied by France.

Because of the division of the country, neurosurgery developed separately in the two independent states. In West Germany, the evolution was promoted by a few personalities who represented different schools according to their own training: these \"surgical neurologists\" emphasized the neurological basis of neurosurgery and were represented by Traugott Riechert and the students of Otfrid Foerster, such as Arist Stender and Hans Kuhlendahl. In contrast, the \"neurological surgeons\" stressed their origins in general surgery. Their main proponent was Wilhelm T\u00f6nnis, who gained particular merit for promoting neurosurgical teaching, the development of new neurosurgical units, and the recognition of neurosurgery as an autonomous specialty. In East Germany, progress was delayed by a weak economy and a repressive political system. Yet several excellent neurosurgeons won international recognition, predominantly Georg Merrem, who came from the school of Fedor Krause. Following a worldwide trend, the number of neurosurgical units in West Germany increased dramatically from 18 in 1950 to 85 in 1988. In 2006, in the unified nation, 1200 certified neurosurgeons in 138 hospital departments and 75 private practices served 82 million people. Since its founding in 1949, the German Neurosurgical Society has promoted the idea of reconciliation and has focused on international collaboration in both science and education. This idea, shared by other European nations, eventually gave rise to the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies. At present, escalating costs in the health sector pose a problem to neurosurgical services and have led to reconsiderations about their structure and financing.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-57649134414", "pmid": "19005391", "issn": "1524-4040", "isbn": "0148-396X", "doi": "10.1227/01.NEU.0000330411.81772.19"}, "source": "Neurosurgery", "authors": [{"first_name": "Hartmut", "last_name": "Collmann"}, {"first_name": "Hans-Ekkehart", "last_name": "Vitzthum"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/historical-perspective-neurosurgery-germany-after-world-war-ii", "year": 2008, "keywords": ["Education, Medical", "Education, Medical: history", "Germany", "Germany, East", "Germany, West", "History, 20th Century", "Humans", "Neurosurgery", "Neurosurgery: history", "Physicians", "Physicians: history", "Portraits as Topic", "Schools, Medical", "Schools, Medical: history", "Societies, Medical", "Societies, Medical: history", "World War II"], "type": "journal", "id": "3b75351c-1a81-3543-8fa0-dbe29ef532ab"}, {"title": "Gross Domestic Product Preliminary Estimate, Q1 2014", "abstract": "Preliminary estimate for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) containing constant price Gross Value Added (GVA) data for the UK.

We aimed to analyze the correlation between 3 widely used macrosocioeconomic status indicators and clinical outcomes.\\n\\nMETHODS: We selected population-based studies reporting incident stroke risk and/or 30-day case-fatality according to prespecified criteria. We used 3 macrosocioeconomic status indicators that are consistently defined by international agencies: per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity, total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity, and unemployment rate. We examined the correlation of each macrosocioeconomic status indicator with incident risk of stroke, 30-day case-fatality, proportion of hemorrhagic strokes, and age at stroke onset.\\n\\nRESULTS: Twenty-three articles comprising 30 population-based studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Age-adjusted incident risk of stroke using the standardized World Health Organization World population was associated to lower per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity (\u03c1=-0.661, P=0.027, R(2)=0.32) and total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity (\u03c1=-0.623, P=0.040, R(2)=0.26). Thirty-day case-fatality rates and proportion of hemorrhagic strokes were also related to lower per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity and total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity. Moreover, stroke occurred at a younger age in populations with low per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity and total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity. There was no correlation between unemployment rates and outcome measures.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Lower per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity and total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity were associated with higher incident risk of stroke, higher case-fatality, a greater proportion of hemorrhagic strokes, and lower age at stroke onset. As a result, these macrosocioeconomic status indicators may be used as proxy measures of quality of primary prevention and acute care and considered as important factors for developing strategies aimed at improving worldwide stroke care.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "22033985", "issn": "00392499", "isbn": "0039-2499", "doi": "10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.632158"}, "source": "Stroke", "authors": [{"first_name": "Luciano A.", "last_name": "Sposato"}, {"first_name": "Gustavo", "last_name": "Saposnik"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/gross-domestic-product-health-expenditure-associated-incidence-30day-fatality-age-stroke-onset-syste", "year": 2012, "keywords": ["employment", "gross domestic product", "health expenditure", "mortality", "socioeconomic status", "stroke incidence"], "type": "journal", "id": "f6bc0f7c-b7e1-3ff4-af0d-ef516b5929ba"}, {"title": "Vocational Training in Germany", "abstract": "In Germany, many professions are learned in dual vocational training courses.

The Example of East Germany", "abstract": "How do protest and its causes change after the democratic transformation of communist regimes? It is argued that certain features of the transformation process have an impact on the conditions that directly influence individual protest participation. These conditions are political discontent, perceived personal political influence, perceived obligation to participate, and integration in protest-.promoting networks. Drawing on the case of East Germany, propositions are suggested about how these four conditions change as a result of the transformation process, and about their differential impact on protest over time. The propositions are tested with a four-wave panel survey of 226 respondents from Leipzig (East Germany) who were interviewed in 1990 (referring to the situation under communist rule), 1993, 1996, and 1998.

I would pore over them in old issues of Nintendo Power magazine, and even try to recreate the levels of my favorite games block by block on pieces of graph paper. I wasn't alone. In the early days of the Super Mario franchise, that's exactly how the folks at Nintendo were designing them. \"Back in the day, we had to create everything by hand,\" says Takashi Tezuka in a video promoting the upcoming level design game Super Mario Maker. \"To design courses, we would actually draw them one at a time on to these sheets of graph paper. We'd then hand our drawings to the programmers, who would code them into a build.\" Screen Shot 2015-06-16 at 11.50.15 AM Screen Shot 2015-06-16 at 11.49.30 AM If they wanted to make changes to the level, however, things got messy on the original document very quickly, so they started sketching out the changes on semi-transparent tracing paper placed over the maps.

It'll also include all-new bells and whistles like a \"Luigi mushroom\" that will give Mario the characteristics of his taller, thinner brother. Super Mario Maker is slated for release on September 11, and you can watch the trailer below, or see some expert players get wrecked by some of its customized levels at the recent Nintendo World Championships.

He describes the transition from antiquity to the Middle Ages as a generally unsettled, frequently violent time of decentralization, depopulation, and shifts of power. Byzantium became the only center of the old Roman Empire while the western empire ceased to exist as such.

At the war's end, the Red Army and Soviet trophy scouts found many major Nazi hideouts. Archives from all over Europe were seized a second time and rushed to Moscow where they remained sequestered for almost half a century. Since the 1991 revelations, extensive negotiations led to the return of archives to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, along with papers seized from Vienna to the Rothschild Family, among others.

Detailed listings provide present locations for the returned holdings.

This hypothesis also implies that the depletions of Cr, V, and Mn which are observed in the Moon were inherited from the mantle of the impactor. Experiments have been undertaken to determine whether the formation of an iron core within a differenti- ated giant planetesimal could have caused depletions of Cr, V, and Mn in the planetesimal mantle, owing to siderophile behavior of these elements during core formation. Partition coefficients of Cr, V, and Mn between metallic iron and the principal mineral phases present in the mantle of a giant planetesimal have been determined at 1500-2000\u00b0C and at 3-25 GPa using an MA-8 apparatus. Cr, V, and Mn were found to remain lithophile (D silicate/metal > 1) under these conditions. It follows that the formation of an iron core within a giant planetesimal would not have caused any depletion of Cr, V, and Mn in its mantle. Depletions of Cr and V (relative to Mg) cannot be attributed to selective volatilization in the solar nebula, prior to planetesimal and planet formation because V is less volatile than Mg, whilst the condensation temperature of Cr is similar to that of Mg and higher than that of Si. Accordingly, it is concluded that the depletions of Cr and V (and probably Mn) in the Moon were not inherited from the mantle of a giant planetesi- mal. Cr, V, and Mn are depleted (relative to Mg) in the Earth's mantle and the terrestrial depletions for these elements are similar to the lunar depletion factor. This similarity suggests that protoln- nar material was derived mainly from the Earth's mantle. Deple- tions of Cr and V (and perhaps Mn) in the terrestrial mantle are believed to have been connected with core-formation processes within the Earth which occurred at much higher pressures and temperatures than those prevailing during core formation in giant planetesimals. ~", "identifiers": {"isbn": "0019-1035"}, "source": "Icarus", "authors": [{"first_name": "A.

The impact is also claimed to have caused major cultural changes and population decline among the Paleoindians. Here, we report a study in which approximately 1,500 radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites in Canada and the United States were used to test the hypothesis that the ET resulted in population decline among the Paleoindians. Following recent studies [e.g., Gamble C, Davies W, Pettitt P, Hazelwood L, Richards M (2005) Camb Archaeol J 15:193-223), the summed probability distribution of the calibrated dates was used to identify probable changes in human population size between 15,000 and 9,000 calBP. Subsequently, potential biases were evaluated by modeling and spatial analysis of the dated occupations. The results of the analyses were not consistent with the predictions of extraterrestrial impact hypothesis. No evidence of a population decline among the Paleoindians at 12,900 +/- 100 calBP was found.

Since gaining widespread attention in 2007, substantial research has focused on testing the 12 main signatures presented as evidence of a catastrophic extraterrestrial event 12,900. years ago. Here we present a review of the impact hypothesis, including its evolution and current variants, and of efforts to test and corroborate the hypothesis.The physical evidence interpreted as signatures of an impact event can be separated into two groups. The first group consists of evidence that has been largely rejected by the scientific community and is no longer in widespread discussion, including: particle tracks in archeological chert; magnetic nodules in Pleistocene bones; impact origin of the Carolina Bays; and elevated concentrations of radioactivity, iridium, and fullerenes enriched in 3He. The second group consists of evidence that has been active in recent research and discussions: carbon spheres and elongates, magnetic grains and magnetic spherules, byproducts of catastrophic wildfire, and nanodiamonds. Over time, however, these signatures have also seen contrary evidence rather than support. Recent studies have shown that carbon spheres and elongates do not represent extraterrestrial carbon nor impact-induced megafires, but are indistinguishable from fungal sclerotia and arthropod fecal material that are a small but common component of many terrestrial deposits. Magnetic grains and spherules are heterogeneously distributed in sediments, but reported measurements of unique peaks in concentrations at the YD onset have yet to be reproduced. The magnetic grains are certainly just iron-rich detrital grains, whereas reported YD magnetic spherules are consistent with the diffuse, non-catastrophic input of micrometeorite ablation fallout, probably augmented by anthropogenic and other terrestrial spherular grains. Results here also show considerable subjectivity in the reported sampling methods that may explain the purported YD spherule concentration peaks. Fire is a pervasive earth-surface process, and reanalyses of the original YD sites and of coeval records show episodic fire on the landscape through the latest Pleistocene, with no unique fire event at the onset of the YD. Lastly, with YD impact proponents increasingly retreating to nanodiamonds (cubic, hexagonal [lonsdaleite], and the proposed n-diamond) as evidence of impact, those data have been called into question. The presence of lonsdaleite was reported as proof of impact-related shock processes, but the evidence presented was inconsistent with lonsdaleite and consistent instead with polycrystalline aggregates of graphene and graphane mixtures that are ubiquitous in carbon forms isolated from sediments ranging from modern to pre-YD age. Important questions remain regarding the origins and distribution of other diamond forms (e.g., cubic nanodiamonds).In summary, none of the original YD impact signatures have been subsequently corroborated by independent tests. Of the 12 original lines of evidence, seven have so far proven to be non-reproducible. The remaining signatures instead seem to represent either (1) non-catastrophic mechanisms, and/or (2) terrestrial rather than extraterrestrial or impact-related sources. In all of these cases, sparse but ubiquitous materials seem to have been misreported and misinterpreted as singular peaks at the onset of the YD. Throughout the arc of this hypothesis, recognized and expected impact markers were not found, leading to proposed YD impactors and impact processes that were novel, self-contradictory, rapidly changing, and sometimes defying the laws of physics. The YD impact hypothesis provides a cautionary tale for researchers, the scientific community, the press, and the broader public. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79955616825", "issn": "00128252", "isbn": "0012-8252", "doi": "10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.02.005"}, "source": "Earth-Science Reviews", "authors": [{"first_name": "Nicholas", "last_name": "Pinter"}, {"first_name": "Andrew C.", "last_name": "Scott"}, {"first_name": "Tyrone L.", "last_name": "Daulton"}, {"first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Podoll"}, {"first_name": "Christian", "last_name": "Koeberl"}, {"first_name": "R.

The authors contend that these symptoms were more reflective of internal organizational problems rather than those of the wider society. In particular: (1) U.S. Army officers did not share the combat burden relative to their large numbers; (2) combat troops were exposed to larger numbers of high-ranking officers with conspicuously greater privileges and immunity from harm than in any previous war; and (3) the career officer system was manifestly corrupt.

Styles in the acceptable \"presentation of self in everyday life\" as well as tropes in the portrayal of feminism in mainstream theatre paralleled both Friedan's concerns in her six books and also, ironically, her increasing marginalization within the evolving feminist movement. Friedan was schooled in leftist unionism and also believed in the power of theatre to convey social ideology. It is worth examining these ideas in order to ask how the goals this essay situates as still radical can be addressed by theatre and performance. Much about the (feminine) mystique of stardom still remains at odds with whatever dramaturgical or topical inroads a playwright might make. The essay suggests that \" third-wave theatre\" (if there is such a thing) and present-day feminist performativity can no more afford to jettison second-wave ideals than can third-wave politics.

While the interchanges have aroused much media interest, the focus of this article is the debates as they are articulated in feminist writing, academic, political, and journalistic, rather than as they are represented in secondary accounts by professional and media observers. The current controversy is located in the response of self-identified feminists to the context of changing socioeconomic and political conditions of the last two decades of the 20th century and identifies issues around sexuality and the family as critical in polarizing feminist opinion. The article traces the discursive patterns and shifts of orientation in the ways in which feminists relate to the family and examines why certain positions gain greater credence at particular times. Greer's feminist writing over thirty years, while idiosyncratic in many ways, is taken as a paradigm of a continuity of purism in feminist thought which resists the current pragmatic approaches of the \"new feminists.

In this case, it was Germaine Greer. I went to see her at the Quarterly Essaylaunch where she talked about her ideas on black/white relations in this country. As I listened to her, I was buoyed, bowled over, by her boldness. In a country which treads cautiously in case anybody gets upset about the issues \u2013 especially whitefellas \u2013 I wanted to clap every word she uttered. Immediately, I went up to her after her speech and said, \u201cYou know, Germaine, I\u2019d walk a million miles to hear a whitefella like yourself say what you said here just now. I\u2019ve been trying to teach about Whiteness for ages.That is, to get whitefellas to look at themselves and not keep researching, studying and labelling us anymore.\u201d But caution: Don\u2019t ask me exactly what she said to prompt my response. Don\u2019t ask me exactly what she wrote. All I know is that it resonated with me. It gave me hope. It replenished my spirit. It spoke to my condition and that of this country. It inspired and \ufb01red me up. Next day, I heard and saw her being interviewed on TV and radio. The interviewers wanted to know what she meant exactly by an Australian Aboriginal Republic. To which she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Don\u2019t know! Now what kind of answer is that, Germaine, in a country where everyone knows about or at least has an opinion on the original inhabitants? There was dead silence and astonishment on the part of the interviewers. Followed by nervous laughter with a faltering \u201cbut you\u2019re the one suggesting it!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Germaine. \u201cI just want to put it out there for people to think about it.\u201d Pregnant pause on part of interviewer. Then move on to next question. I thought to myself, Good on you, Germaine \u2013 \ufb01nally a whitefella who can admit to \u201cnot knowing\u201d. In this quantitative, measured, controlled society we live in, where one is expected \u201cto know\u201d at all times, at all costs, where there are so many \u201cexperts\u201d on Aborigines, it\u2019s refreshing to hear such an august and audacious academic say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I hadn\u2019t heard whitefellas talking like this for a long time. And my spirit was in sore need of succour. The last time I got such a hit of hope was from Jane Elliott in 1997 just after a rather nasal-voiced, mean-spirited, suburban redhead from Ipswich emerged. Thank God there are such people as Jane and Germaine who will say such things. Provoke. Confront the complacency. It has to come from them. It can\u2019t come from us mob because we get labelled as \u201ccarping boongs or whingeing blackfellas\u201d if we as much as confront/criticise this rich and abundant but racialised country in which we live. It has to come from the power and privilege of Whiteness which both women both inhabit, daily. Germaine Greer picked up lots of \u201cbrownie points\u201d (no pun intended) from me and my fellow blackfella mate Gary Thomas. We were the only two Aboriginal people present at the launch. I said to him as we left, \u201cWhat did you think of Germaine Greer?\u201d Without hesitation, he said, \u201cI really liked her because she is not afraid to dream \u2026 and to dream big, Lill.\u201d What an accolade from an Aborigine! And, yes, I agree! We need to dream, dream big, dream this country into full existence. And, like Germaine, don\u2019t ask me exactly what I mean by that.

That history begins with the social lives and rituals of our primate ancestors. As our ancestors' social world grew increasingly complex, their mental powers grew in concert. Among these mental powers was an increasingly sophisticated imagination. A supernatural world filled with gods, spirits, and ancestors was an outgrowth of that imagination-especially children's imagination. Belief in the supernatural provided important adaptive benefits. Religion's initial adaptive benefit was its power to heal. Quickly, though, this benefit was augmented by religion's power to create highly cooperative and cohesive groups. So significant were these benefits that eventually human groups bonded together by religion out-competed all other groups and literally conquered the world.

Focusing on crucial turning points in life--birth, marriage, and death--the tales feature wandering spirits, marriage with demons, werewolves, speaking heads, possession by dybbuks (souls of the dead who enter the bodies of the living), and every other kind of supernatural adversary.

He began by reconceptualizing the character's physiological structure as sentient plant matter, rather than as the mutated and monstrous human being first developed by Len Wein and Berni Wrightson in 1971.1 All that was left of biochemist Alec Holland after the bio-restorative formula explosion plunged him into the swamp slime was consciousness; Moore revealed that the creature was little more than living vegetation in the shape of a man, one whose \"humanity\" operated like phantom limbs on a mossy, hulking frame. With this transformation, Moore's Swamp Thing could move freely about his environment by willfully allowing his body to die and reanimate anywhere plants thrive. Swamp Thing, while still an aberrant presence among his human neighbors, developed a more interdependent relationship with the land and became a deeply compassionate guardian of the Green. Even as Moore altered Swamp Thing's form to make him more versatile, mobile, and intellectually complex, a second major modification fixed the character more firmly in space and time by establishing the comic's setting in and around present-day Houma, Louisiana. After determining \"which swamps he was the Thing of,\" Moore told interviewer George Khoury that he researched the area's history and culture as well as its geographic features, \"so that I could use the location, so that I could get interesting images or atmospheres from it\" (Khoury 88). The results of Moore's research are vividly manifested through the artistic style of Stephen Bissette who, along with other artists including John Totleben, Alfredo Alcala, and Ron Randall, brought a darker, more intricate realism to the series.2 It is through these collaborative efforts to convey the regional \"atmospheres\" of Swamp Thing that we see a more focused engagement with United States southern history and its landscape of horrors, including storylines that grapple with the region's legacy of slavery. This essay takes a closer look at Moore's depiction of the South and the manner in which Swamp Thing comments upon social and cultural histories of racial oppression. My analysis will focus, in particular, on two issues from the \"American Gothic\" story arc that employ well-known comic book horror tropes to illustrate a tale of vengeful slaves and unrepentant masters: \"Southern Change\" (#41) and \"Strange Fruit\" (#42). These issues, published in 1985, adapt many of the formal and aesthetic qualities of early horror comics, yet my reading also connects the ideological thrust of Swamp Thing's zombie tale with the post-civil rights era development of the \"postmodern slave narrative\"-a literary sub-genre similarly concerned with issues of historical recovery, cultural rebirth, and identity formation.3 I maintain, for instance, that the concept of \"rememory\" that Toni Morrison develops in her 1988 novel, Beloved, is useful in framing an experiential understanding of the present as being physically and psychologically inscribed with traces of the past. Described by Caroline Rody as a trope that \"postulates the interconnectedness of minds, past and present,\" rememory is used as both a verb and a noun in Morrison's novel to convey the lasting materiality of thoughts and emotional resonances. In Beloved, the main character regards places as entities stratified with \"thought pictures\" that, once formed by a person or an event, endure with an affective potency that can be perceived by others.4 These interminable \"thought pictures\" of rememory can also describe the way southern history is understood in Swamp Thing. Rather than simply exhuming the inarticulate monsters of Tales from the Crypt, Moore and Bissette complicate the discourse of zombification and spiritual possession to foreground a trauma that reaches beyond the grave. What is especially significant about Moore's unearthing of the past in \"Southern Change\" and \"Strange Fruit,\" I argue, is the way in which the no-longer-human body of Swamp Thing is juxtaposed against the dehumanization of the enslaved blacks on the Robertaland Plantation. They, too, are objectified and physically bound to the land, and as their restless bones push up through the earth, they also clamor for freedom: \"Freedom from this blighted soil, where buried grievances have poisoned the roots of the world and all its cultures. Freedom from these tainted lands that bear such sour fruit\" (\"Strange Fruit\" 42:3). To be sure, Alec Holland's past as a white American scientist never included generations of forced slave labor. Still, the subtle narrative correlations that Moore employs to heighten Swamp Thing's encounter with the South ultimately furnish the material horrors of black enslavement with psychological resonance. Multiple codes of signification in the slave uprising coalesce around the discourses of nature, moral reciprocity, and memory that are central to Swamp Thing. In his new form, as protector of the land and its residents, Swamp Thing must do more than empathize with the plight of the enslaved; his charge is to end the cycle of pain and injustice that will free the victimized blacks and allow them to rest in peace. His decision to destroy the Louisiana plantation in a fire that consumes most of the undead slaves reaffirms the idea of the southern past as a riotous, uncontrolled growth that must not be allowed to thrive in the present. Swamp Thing's experience demonstrates that like a stubborn weed, history's evils will be continually rehearsed-literally, in this case, by a TV crew using Robertaland to film a new southern soap opera-until the old growth is burned out. Such dangers are further manifest through anxieties over zombification, where \"to succumb is to become, and once you have become a zombie, self is lost irrevocably to the other\" (Boon 35). The comic makes creative use of metaphors of enslavement in zombie folklore to convey larger fears about the monstrous clamoring of history. As a result, while the story presupposes the importance of remembering the past, the conclusion's anti-pastoral uprooting also warns against the dangers of being consumed (and enslaved) by it. My reading of Swamp Thing seeks to contribute to emerging conversations in African American cultural and literary studies about racial representation in modern American comics. The last decade has seen a preponderance of critically acclaimed comics that explore African American history and legend in an effort to demystify-to expose misconceptions and reveal new dimensions of black subjectivity. In works such as Nat Turner by Kyle Baker and King: A Comics Biography of Martin Luther King, Jr. by Ho Che Anderson, the comics medium doubles as an archive for the creative exploration of key moments, figures, and evolving ideologies.5 The push toward realism is understandable given the way black people and other ethnic groups have often fared on the comics page. From indecipherable buffoons and minstrels to the infantilized primitives of jungle comics, black comic book characters have been utilized as projections of white fears and fantasies since the Depression Era. Comics that seek to represent the inner lives of black men and women in a more nuanced and visually complex manner help to counter prevailing racial stereotypes while depicting a view of the past that will set the record straight. In his essay, \"Drawing on History in Recent African American Graphic Novels,\" Michael Chaney provides a cogent analysis of how texts like Anderson's King seek \"to discover or invent a usable history\" for African Americans through the comics medium (199). Yet even as the storytelling strategies in more comics cross genres and experiment with narrative and aesthetic innovations, their representations are largely mimetic, tethered to an understanding of coherent historical realities and often affirmed by \"authenticating documents\" (prefatory material, primary sources, bibliographies) appended to the comic.6 Swamp Thing's evocative departure from these trends begins with its adaptation of fantasy and horror conventions. Moore and Bissette employ what literary critic Timothy A. Spaulding describes as a \"non-mimetic approach to slavery\" that foregrounds the supernatural and otherworldly, fracturing space and time in a way that dismantles totalizing narratives of history in a manner not unlike novels such as Flight to Canada by Ishmael Reed (1976), Kindred by Octavia Butler (1979), Middle Passage by Charles Johnson (1990), and more recently, Edward P. Jones's The Known World (2003).", "identifiers": {"isbn": "9781617030185"}, "source": "Comics and the U.S. South", "authors": [{"first_name": "Q J", "last_name": "Whitted"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/slaves-other-swamp-things-black-southern-history-comic-book-horror", "year": 2012, "type": "book", "id": "8c94599f-ea1b-36b8-a781-fba229c244ea"}, {"title": "Scare tactics: Supernatural fiction by American women", "abstract": "Scare Tactics identifies an important but overlooked tradition of supernatural writing by American women. Jeffrey Weinstock analyzes this tradition as an essentially feminist attempt to imagine alternatives to a world of limited possibilities. In the process, he recovers the lives and works of authors who were important during their lifetimes and in the development of the American literary tradition, but who are not recognized today for their contributions. Between the end of the Civil War and roughly 1930, hundreds of uncanny tales were published by women in the periodical press and in books. These include stories by familiar figures such as Edith Wharton, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, as well as by authors almost wholly unknown to twenty-first-century readers, such as Josephine Dodge Bacon, Alice Brown, Emma Frances Dawson, and Harriet Prescott Spofford. Focusing on this tradition of female writing offers a corrective to the prevailing belief within American literary scholarship that the uncanny tale, exemplified by the literary productions of Irving, Poe, and Hawthorne, was displaced after the Civil War by literary realism. Beyond the simple existence of an unacknowledged tradition of uncanny literature by women, Scare Tactics makes a strong case that this body of literature should be read as a specifically feminist literary tradition. Especially intriguing, Weinstock demonstrates, is that women authors repeatedly used Gothic conventions to express discontentment with circumscribed roles for women creating types of political intervention connected to the broader sphere of women's rights activism. Paying attention to these overlooked authors helps us better understand not only the literary marketplace of their time, but also more familiar American Gothicists from Edgar Allan Poe to Shirley Jackson to Stephen King. \u00a9 2008 Fordham University Press.

I argue that the theory of melodramatic identification can be employed not only to understand soap opera viewers but also viewers of many other kinds of television, particularly cult TV with its frequent reliance on serialized melodramatic narratives. I further argue that not only is Supernatural a melodramatic text, but also that text must be viewed as extending beyond the narrative world proper to the multiple narratives or texts comprised by the industrial and cultural context of the show. These together constitute a multilayered melodrama with which the fan identifies and to which she can also contribute through extratextual fan activities. That is, participation in slash and Wincest communities can be viewed as expression of melodramatic identification.

Its ability to complement the Arabidopsis scr mutant phenotype suggests conservation of function, yet its expression pattern during embryogenesis and in the shoot system indicates divergence. ZmSCR expression was detected early during embryogenesis and localized to the endodermal lineage in the root, showing a gradual regionalization of expression. Expression of ZmSCR appeared to be analogous to that of SCR during leaf formation. However, its absence from the maize shoot meristem and its early expression pattern during embryogenesis suggest a diversification of ZmSCR in the patterning processes in maize. To further investigate the evolutionary relationship of SCR and ZmSCR, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using Arabidopsis, rice and maize SCARECROW-LIKE genes (SCLs). We found SCL23 to be the most closely related to SCR in both eudicots and monocots, suggesting that a gene duplication resulting in SCR and SCL23 predates the divergence of dicots and monocots.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "16244911", "issn": "01674412", "isbn": "0167-4412 (Print)\\r0167-4412 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1007/s11103-005-0578-y"}, "source": "Plant Molecular Biology", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jun", "last_name": "Lim"}, {"first_name": "Jee W.", "last_name": "Jung"}, {"first_name": "Eun Lim", "last_name": "Chae"}, {"first_name": "Mi Hyun", "last_name": "Lee"}, {"first_name": "Jun Kim", "last_name": "Bong"}, {"first_name": "Miran", "last_name": "Kim"}, {"first_name": "Wesley B.", "last_name": "Bruce"}, {"first_name": "Philip N.", "last_name": "Benfey"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/conservation-diversification-scarecrow-maize", "year": 2005, "keywords": ["Arabidopsis", "GRAS family", "Pattern formation", "Root development", "SCARECROW"], "type": "journal", "id": "cbc1eb05-a705-39bd-b75d-f2df89cf10d1"}, {"title": "Chapter One: \u201cIs this a book?\u201d DC Vertigo and the redefinition of comics in the 1990s", "abstract": "Not only comics publishing but also perceptions of it have changed radically during this century and the comic book has become a graphic novel; invoking notions of permanence, literariness and artistry. This chapter will examine the changes that brought about this redefinition in the 1990s, specifically with regard to the role of DC Vertigo and the rise of the trade paperback. Building on the popularity of British creators in the 1980s and the success of titles such as Hellblazer and Animal Man, DC launched their Vertigo imprint in 1993, with Neil Gaimans The Sandman as their flagship title. Having the somewhat paradoxical aim of uniting unique creative voices under one imprint, the majority of Vertigo titles (which feature original characters) are creator-owned and the Vertigo stable is comprised mainly of British authors, many of whom were recruited while writing for 2000AD in the 1980s. Vertigo puts out more trade paperbacks than any other imprint and their great success in marketing the trade paperback form in many senses paved the way for other publishers to repackage their material in similar form. After summarising the position of comics at the close of the 1980s (British invasion, emergent star writers, direct distribution) this chapter proceeds to discuss the emergence of the trade paperback in the 1990s and its role in redefining comics. Relevant industry factors will include: technical advances digitising and reproduction has led to higher production values; but also perhaps a homogeneity of style; employment changes everything has been brought in-house; marketing changes (star writer) uses romantic ideology to assign an author function; maxi-series versus ongoing serialisation new permanence of product; writing for a multi-issue story-arc. Outside factors will also be discussed, including: emergent IP law this has given more control to the creator; but freezes shared symbols and limits development; mechanical reproduction comic book as product; multiple forms; fan culture mid 1990s speculators market crash; neglect of child market; social context/cultural expectations celebrity culture responsible for the emergence of star writers; youth culture and resisting definition as childrens literature; new media trade paperbacks mirror DVD releases (including extras); bookstore distribution challenge to direct marketing of 1980s; brings comics closer to proper books; reliant upon author function.

Resisting the claim that the media \"\"brainwash\"\" teens, Clark argues that today's popular stories of demons, hell, and the afterlife actually have their roots in the U.S.'s religious heritage. She considers why some young people are nervous about supernatural stories in the media, while others comfortably and often unselfconsciously blur the boundaries between those stories of the realm beyond that belong to traditional religion and those offered by the entertainment media. At a time of increased religious pluralism and declining participation in formal religious institutions, Clark says, we must completely reexamine what young people mean-and what they may believe-when they identify themselves as \"\"spiritual\"\" or \"\"religious.\"\" Offering provocative insights into how the entertainment media shape contemporary religious ideas and practices, From Angels to Aliens paints a surprising-and perhaps alarming-portrait of the spiritual state of America's youth.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "12841412", "issn": "0021-9916", "isbn": "0195156099"}, "source": "JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION", "authors": [{"first_name": "H", "last_name": "Warren"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/angels-aliens-teenagers-media-supernatural", "year": 2004, "type": "journal", "id": "89fac10a-3c5b-33e4-a49e-8372449ff567"}, {"title": "The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: Richard Feynman on Intrinsic Motivation", "abstract": "Minute 24:55 \"I don't know anything about the Nobel Prize.

The traditional knowledge, cultural, spiritual and nutritional values attached to these livelihood systems demonstrate that they are not merely a technique of land use but their way of life. Most of the countries in Asia have adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) that guarantees the rights of indigenous peoples to continue their traditional land use systems. Despite this widespread adoption, there are policies on land use that consider shifting cultivation, as a driver of deforestation in many countries in Asia. These policies are damaging indigenous land use systems and have resulted in food insecurity, loss of biodiversity and traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples. Mr. Hiroyoki Konuma, Assistant Director General and Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific (FAO-RAP), giving his welcome remarks to the participants of the \" Regional Multi-Stakeholder Consultation on Indigenous Peoples Livelihood and Food Security \" said that shifting cultivation has been portrayed as the enemy of forest conservation. \u200b The victimization \u200b of \u200b shifting cultivation should be avoided. Mr. Konuma added that our aim should be to highlight the good practices of indigenous peoples and protect such traditional livelihoods that are important to indigenous peoples and also for us. \" Mr. Konuma also added that \" Unless we target indigenous peoples, who are one of the largest portion of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in our society and work together with them as key partners, we would not be able to eradicate poverty and hunger, and our fundamental goal of equitable growth, social stability and sustainable development would never be achieved. \" The regional consultation was co-organized by Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact (AIPP) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) with the support of International Work for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA) and Rainforest Foundation Norway (RFN) on 28-30 August 2014 at Hotel Amora in Chiang Mai, Thailand. 51 representatives of indigenous peoples, civil society organizations and governments from Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam actively participated in the consultation. The case studies from Cambodia, India, Lao PDR and Nepal on shifting cultivation, food security and livelihoods of indigenous peoples were presented in the consultation. These case studies were the results of the joint initiative of AIPP and FAO under \" Regional Support to Indigenous Peoples for Livelihood and Food Security. \" The case studies reaffirmed what indigenous peoples have been advocating for many years, that shifting cultivation is playing a significant role in providing livelihoods and ensuring food security to indigenous communities. The studies also reconfirmed that indigenous peoples' life and culture are intricately linked to shifting cultivation. Also, the traditional shifting cultivation with the fallow cycle of 7 to 10 years is sustainable and does not lead to deforestation unless land scarcity compels farmers to clear new land in forest areas. The videos on shifting cultivation from Lao PDR and Thailand were also screened during the consultation.", "year": 2014, "source": "Environment Programme", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/shifting-cultivation-cultural-heritage-indigenous-communities-source-livelihoods-food-security-indig", "authors": [{"last_name": "Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact"}], "id": "4495bc39-221f-35d6-8c46-3aec1d836efa"}, {"title": "GUIDELINES ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES", "abstract": "Section I - Overview of current realities confronting indigenous peoples and the international norms and standards established to address indigenous peoples issues Section II - Practical table and checklist of key issues and related human rights...........

There are major health discrepancies in immune-mediated diseases between Caucasians and Canadian Aboriginal people, as well as with other indigenous people of the Americas. Environmental factors offer a limited explanation as Aboriginal people also demonstrate a rare resistance to chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are known modulators of viral responses and autoimmune diseases. The possibility that variation in KIR cluster profiles contribute to the health outcomes of Aboriginal people was evaluated with Canadian Caucasian (n=93, population controls) and Aboriginal (n=86) individuals. Relative to Caucasians, the Aboriginal KIR cluster displayed a greater immune activating phenotype associated with genes of the B haplotype situated within the telomeric region. In conjunction, there was a decrease in the genes of the B haplotype from the centromeric region. Caucasian and Aboriginal cohorts further demonstrated distinct genotype and haplotype relationships enforcing the disconnect between the B haplotype centromeric and telomeric regions within the Aboriginal population. Moreover, Caucasian KIR cluster patterns reflected studies of Caucasians globally, as well as Asians. In contrast, the unique pattern of the Canadian Aboriginal cohort mirrored the phenotype of other indigenous peoples of the Americas, but not that of Caucasians or Asians. Taken together, these data suggest that historically indigenous peoples of the Americas were subject to immune selection processes that could be influencing the current disease resistance and susceptibility patterns of their descendents.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-81455131733", "pmid": "21731058", "issn": "1018-4813", "doi": "10.1038/ejhg.2011.114"}, "source": "European Journal of Human Genetics", "authors": [{"first_name": "Julia D", "last_name": "Rempel"}, {"first_name": "Kim", "last_name": "Hawkins"}, {"first_name": "Erin", "last_name": "Lande"}, {"first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Nickerson"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/potential-influence-kir-cluster-profiles-disease-patterns-canadian-aboriginals-other-indigenous-peop", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["ethnicity", "kir centromeric", "kir telomeric", "pro-inflammatory immunity"], "type": "journal", "id": "bb27ae23-9f0d-3ef2-9b4d-e22d109525d4"}, {"title": "State of the World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples", "abstract": "Indigenous peoples are custodians of some of the most biologically diverse territories in the world.

One appointed solution is the use of algae which have higher productivity per unit area when compared with other feedstocks. In light of this, the total area, including water and land required for the European Union (EU), the United States (US), and Brazil was determined using international policies and targets, the present and future diesel demand, the current biodiesel production (released by international organizations), and specific data of algae productivity from the literature. GIS software was used to locate possible cities where algae cultivation could occur nearby. Bearings on the availability of area (flat and unoccupied zones), favourable climate, proximity to the process inputs (such as nutrients (preferably from municipal waste water treatment), CO2 and water sources) and political boundaries were used as assessment criteria. It was possible to identify seven suitable cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants in the EU, two in the USA and thirteen in Brazil. It was also shown that it is possible to attain targets required by current policies and replace diesel with algae-derived diesel based on attainable cultivation areas.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84921926853", "issn": "09601481", "doi": "10.1016/j.renene.2014.12.059"}, "source": "Renewable Energy", "authors": [{"first_name": "Lais Galileu", "last_name": "Speranza"}, {"first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Ingram"}, {"first_name": "Gary A", "last_name": "Leeke"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/assessment-algae-biodiesel-viability-based-area-requirement-european-union-united-states-brazil", "year": 2015, "type": "journal", "id": "58b221f7-55d7-32eb-ba65-f4277c163a92"}, {"title": "Absorptive capacity and openness of small biopharmaceutical firms - a European Union-United States comparison", "abstract": "The complementarities between internal capabilities and external linkages have been widely acknowledged in the open innovation literature, yet little is known about the extent to which internal capabilities affect firms' openness within different institutional contexts. This paper therefore empirically explores the relationship between absorptive capacity (ACAP) and openness in the United States and European biopharmaceutical sectors. Based on analysis of data from a large-scale international survey of 349 biopharmaceutical firms in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, the results suggest that exploratory openness depends more strongly on the research and development (R&D) aspect of firms' potential absorptive capacity, whereas exploitative openness is more conditional on firms' realized absorptive capacity (RACAP). The results also highlight the major differences between firms' openness and ACAP in the United States and Europe - in the United States, firms' skill levels prove more significant in contributing to firms' engagement with exploratory relationships, whereas in Europe, continuity of R&D proves more important. Engagement with exploitative relationships, however, is more conditional on firms' RACAP in Europe only. \u00a9 2013 The Author.

This question carries weight in that a probe for its answer could not only illuminate the nature of Cold War conflict but also explain America's still uneasy relations with some less-developed countries. Building on world system theory but expanding it further, I argue that politico-economic attributes of the region, toward which US policy is directed, account for the disparate outcomes. As the hegemonic power, the United States after World War II bore the brunt of tearing down obstacles that hampered the expansion of the market economy and its 'political underpinning,' liberal democracy. An array of challenges to this task was not uniform, however, because distinctive political development ensued in different parts of the capitalist system. High-profit business undertakings afforded the core a viable capital-labor alliance in the mid-20th century. Politics overall stable here, the United States encountered little systemic threat and dispensed with heavy-handed interventionism. In postwar Germany, the United States groomed the ally as the engine of European recovery by facilitating reindustrialization. Presence of capital-intensive industries bequeathed West Germany flexible labor-management relations, and the reign of liberal democracy obviated the need of hegemonic intervention. Low value-added economic activities in the periphery, in the meantime, rendered interclass compromise not feasible. Utilizing manual labor extensively, factory owners and landlords here were ill disposed towards economic concessions and working-class empowerment. Impoverished, disenfranchised workers/peasants frequently threatened the survival of free market, and this triggered America's armed intervention. Post-colonial Korea inherited the agitated masses, who suffered through the feudalistic land tenure system and the police state under the Japanese rule. Upon liberation, awakened workers/peasants formed grassroots organizations and called for thorough political, economic reform. Because these revolutionaries could not be co-opted, the United States neutralized them with force and aligned the emerging South Korean republic with the anti-Communist bloc.

This commentary describes the influence of a lawsuit pursued by workers of an Italian VC plant on the recent scientific debate on VC exposure and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Original studies carried out by consultants of the public prosecutors and by independent researchers supported the above association. VC-industry consultants published two reviews during the lawsuit, claiming that liver angiosarcoma was the only VC-related cancer. The judges concluded that the evidence of the association between HCC and VC was still not convincing. After the trial, the risk of HCC was confirmed by a re-assessment of VC carcinogenicity from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, but other subsequent industry-funded reviews criticized the new evidence. Industry-funded authors cited each other, and rarely disclosed conflicts of interest. Based on a network of collaborating researchers, industrial interests can shape the literature enhancing the background noise surrounding the scientific evidence. Am. J. Ind.

The economic crisis is likely to have contributed to further growth in obesity. Social disparities in obesity persist, and have increased in some countries. A growing number of countries have adopted policies to prevent obesity from spreading further. Mexico, for instance, has launched one of the most comprehensive government strategies to address the problem in 2013, including awareness-raising, health care, regulatory and fiscal measures. Several countries have developed multi-stakeholder frameworks, involving business and civil society actors in the development of public health policies.

The book should thus be of interest to scholars working in all these areas, and it would also be appropriate for graduate or advanced undergraduate courses. Perhaps because it aims to speak to multiple literatures, however, the book lacks a single overarching theoretical frame that would make the nature of its contribution explicit, and the author does not fully draw out the more general implications of her three cases. It would have been profitable, for example, to elaborate more fully what the case of sexual harassment policy tells us about issue framing in social movements, or about the impact of common-law versus civil-law legal systems on state policy. The historically novel role of a supranational entity, too, could have been given more attention. Nevertheless, the book offers numerous intriguing insights, and ultimately provides a compelling argument that political processes both reflect and contribute to the ongoing production and reproduction of gender relations.

I\u2019d only add that it was just the latest in a series of alerts that sounded during the first decade of this new century. In a very short time, we\u2019ve become aware of global climate change; of the geopolitical issues surrounding energy and water supplies; of the vulnerabilities of supply chains for food, medicine and even talent; and of sobering threats to global security. The common denominator? The realities \u2014 and challenges \u2014 of global integration. We occupy a world that is connected on multiple dimensions, and at a deep level \u2014 a global system of systems. That means, among other things, that it is subject to systems-level failures, which require systems-level thinking about the effectiveness of its physical and digital infrastructures. It is this unprecedented level of interconnection and interdependency that underpins the most important findings contained in this report. Inside this revealing view into the agendas of global business and public sector leaders, three widely shared perspectives stand in relief. 1) The world\u2019s private and public sector leaders believe that a rapid escalation of \u201ccomplexity\u201d is the biggest challenge confronting them. They expect it to continue \u2014 indeed, to accelerate \u2014 in the coming years. 2) They are equally clear that their enterprises today are not equipped to cope effectively with this complexity in the global environment. 3) Finally, they identify \u201ccreativity\u201d as the single most important leadership competency for enterprises seeking a path through this complexity. What we heard through the course of these in-depth discussions (my own interview took place on December 2, 2009) is that events, threats and opportunities aren\u2019t just coming at us faster or with less predictability; they are converging and influencing each other to create entirely unique situations. These firsts-of-their-kind developments require unprecedented degrees of creativity \u2014 which has become a more important leadership quality than attributes like management discipline, rigor or operational acumen. As always, our biennial examination of the priorities of CEOs around the world provides terrific insight into both the world as they see it, and ultimately, what sets the highest-performing enterprises apart. For me personally, I find one fact especially fascinating. Over the course of more than 1,500 face-to-face interviews with CEOs and other leaders, not a single question contained the term \u201cSmarter Planet\u201d\u2014 and yet the conversations yielded primary findings that speak directly to exactly what IBM has been saying about the challenges and opportunities of this fundamental shift in the way the world works.

In our past three global CEO studies, CEOs consistently said that coping with change was their most pressing challenge. In 2010, our conversa- tions identified a new primary challenge: complexity. CEOs told us they operate in a world that is substantially more volatile, uncertain and complex. Many shared the view that incremental changes are no longer sufficient in a world that is operating in fundamentally different ways. Four primary findings arose from our conversations: Todays complexity is only expected to rise, and more than half of CEOs doubt their ability to manage it. Seventy-nine percent of CEOs anticipate even greater complexity ahead. However, one set of organizations we call them Standouts has turned increased complexity into financial advantage over the past five years. Creativity is the most important leadership quality, according to CEOs. Standouts practice and encourage experimentation and innovation throughout their organizations. Creative leaders expect to make deeper business model changes to realize their strategies.

Greater abnormal CEO power lowers CEOs' pay for performance sensitivity, but again the relation is driven by observations under weak external monitoring.

Digital technologies are bringing choice and variety to viewers as never before. Digital platforms, like cable, satellite and broadband, are developing rapidly. They are making new types of content available and new ways of experiencing it, from High Definition to video-on-demand. Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) is one very important part of this new television landscape. Digital switchover will mean that DTT services are available throughout the UK \u2013 allowing DTT to become the way in which we ensure that the whole country has access to Public Service Broadcasting, free-to-air. Under the Communications Act, Parliament gave Ofcom important responsibilities for the regulation of DTT. These are wider and deeper than our responsibilities for other television platforms, reflecting the role that DTT has in making PSB content available to all. We think it is very important that the regulation of DTT allows it to stay at the forefront of broadcasting - adopting new technologies, so it can offer new services, and make the very best use of valuable spectrum. This document sets out our thoughts on how the DTT platform could evolve over the next few years. In brief, it describes a tremendous opportunity - to begin upgrading DTT by embracing the latest technologies. These have the potential to bring huge increases in capacity to the platform, enabling it to offer richer and more varied services, including High Definition. Our proposals describe how this huge prize can be achieved without needing more spectrum, while protecting existing viewers\u2019 access to the existing PSB services.

In addition, environmental gamma and UV radiation, as well as several chemicals also generate reactive oxygen species, which induce oxidative stress. Thus oxidative stress constitutes a major threat to organisms living in aerobic environments. Oxidative stress induces the expression of several genes in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the primary sensor(s) that trigger the response is unknown. This study demonstrates that primary sensors of osmotic stress, the Sln1p-Ssk1p two-component proteins, are involved in sensing oxidative stress specifically induced by hydrogen peroxide and diamide, but not by other oxidants used in the study. Wild type and sln1-ssk1 mutant were treated with hydrogen peroxide, diamide, menadione, UV, and gamma-radiation. Results show that sln1-ssk1 mutant is only sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and diamide but not to other oxidants. S. cerevisiae contains an additional cell surface osmosensor, Sho1p, that targets the osmotic signal to Hog1p. Data is presented that shows Sho1 and Hog1 proteins are also involved in signaling oxidant-specific cellular damage. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that expression of the mammalian homolog of Hog1p provides protection from oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that Sln1p-Ssk1p and Sho1p signal transduction pathways participate in oxidative stress response.

Brand managers tend to create more lovable brands, e.g. McDonald's \"I'm lovin it\". However, the importance of this concept is not frequently discussed in marketing literature. Furthermore, the impact of brand personality and brand image on brand love has not been investigated in any empirical research. This paper aims to address this gap by developing a causal model incorporating brand love, brand personality, brand image and word of mouth (WOM) to investigate the relationships among them. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Data were collected using a survey method and usable questionnaires were completed by 250 undergraduate students. Path analysis was used to test the hypotheses using AMOS 16.0. Findings \u2013 Results revealed that only brand image is considered as a determinant of brand love that affects WOM along with brand personality. Practical implications \u2013 Results provide detailed implications and a platform on which future research can be built. Originality/value \u2013 The extant love research seems to be solely in the US context. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the concept of brand love outside the USA.

In West Germany the division is more traditional and preference effects are greater, but gender differences in these are insignificant. The U.S. division of domestic task falls between the two German regions, and the gender difference in preference effects is the greatest, with U.S. men\u2019s preferences predicting significantly more variance than do U.S. women\u2019s.

Podokesaurus holyokensis Talbot is one of the forms of which the type fossil is far from satisfactory, and the more this monotypic genus (the type species of which was founded on a single fragmentary skeleton long since destroyed) is studies, the more surely does it appear that Podokesaurus is synonymous with the genus Coelophysis.

Here, we report on the vertebrate fossil-bearing Jurassic stratigraphy from Linglongta, Jianchang County, western Liaoning, including a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon date unambiguously associated with the fossil horizons. The primary goal was to determine the vertebrate fossil-bearing succession. A further aim was to provide age estimations for the fossil-bearing horizon as well as the earliest appearance of feathered dinosaurs, the eutherian-placental clade, and transitional pterosaurs. Field investigations showed that the vertebrate fossil-bearing stratigraphie succession in Jianchang County mainly consists of basal andesites overlain by rhythmic tuffs and tuffaceous lacustrine sediments, with the upper intermediate or acidic lavas interbedded with laminated more or less tuffaceous lacustrine deposits. This sequence correlates well with the Middle Jurassic Lanqi/Tiaojishan Formation in northeastern China. Detailed and accurate field observations showed that the well-preserved vertebrate fossils were buried in either the middle or the upper fine-grained laminated lacustrine deposits. Previous and current SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dates provide an age estimation of 161-159 Myr for the fossil-bearing horizon and vertebrates. This indicates that the earliest appearance of feathered dinosaurs here was more than 159 Myr ago and unquestionably older than Archaeopteryx from Germany, making these the earliest known feathered dinosaurs in the world. Furthermore, the eutherian-placental clade and the known transitional pterosaurs first emerged no later than 161 Myr. The vertebrate assemblage unearthed recently from Linglongta and neighboring areas in Jianchang County belongs to the Daohugou Biota.

The discovery of Central Asian fauna opened up the borders of distribution of ornithomimids, the remains of which were fond in Northern China and Mongolia (Gilmore, 1933; Russell, 1972; Osmolska et al., 1972; Kielan- Jaworowska and Barsbold, 1972). In recent years the collection of toothless theropods has widened considerably, especially due to the additions to the collection of the Soviet- Mongolian paleontological expedition, which facilitated a fuller examination of questions of systematics, morphology, and evolution of these specific carnivorous dinosaurs, currently classified as belonging to the infraorders Ornithomimosauria and Oviraptorosauria (Barsbold, 1976a, 1977). In the first group are found garudimimids, primitive ornithomimosaurs, which in the area of skull anatomy confirmed the specificity of the structure of the capsular basisphenoid, initially established in the Mongolian ornithomimids (Osmolska et al., 1972), which comprise a progressive branch. The second group includes Oviraptor (Barsbold, 1976a, b), which in the initial stage of investigation was classified with the ornithomimids (Osborn, 1924) mainly due to its toothlessness and having been preserved in a similar position (Rozhdectvenskiy and Tatrinov, 1961; Lapparent and Laocat, 1955; Huene, 1956; Romer, 1956; Kuhn, 1966; White, 1973). Beside the Oviraptor itself (Osborn, 1924), in the currently obtained new material with a high degree of preservation, stands out the specific genus Ingenia, classified in the new sub-family oviraptorid. 3 Similarities were shown recently (Osmolska, 1976) between the lower jaw of Oviraptor and Caenagnathus Sternberg, 1940 (in which this is the only part that is known), which was earlier identified as belonging to birds (Sternberg, 1940; Cracraft, 1971). H. Osmul\u2019skaya (Osmolska, 1976) allows the possibility of unifying Oviraptor and Caenagnathus in an earlier identified family Caenagnathidae Sternberg, 1940. However, considerable differences in the structure of the lower jaw of Caenagnathus and Oviraptor make it necessary to assign them to different families, which enter the infra-order Oviraptorosauria.

Regardless of how aerial behaviors might have arisen, we can analyze the physical effects of structural changes on aerial maneuvering as they present themselves in fossils and along evolutionary lineages. To accomplish this, we measured the aerodynamic maneuvering characteristics of a series of models based on Mesozoic birds and avian ancestors to determine whether or not measures of aerodynamic performance correlated with morphological changes. Maneuvering characteristics during glides were quantified by measuring static stability (dC/da; the tendency to experience righting moments when deflected from equilibrium) and control effectiveness (dC/dd; the amount of force or moment generated for each degree of movement of a limb or control surface). We found that changes in planform, such as the presence or absence of a feathered tail or of leg feathers or the reconstructed posture of the animal, can drastically alter static stability. In addition, appendage function (e.g. as an elevator, rudder, or aileron, generating control forces and torques in different directions) also depends on posture and glide angle, and the function of appendages can shift dramatically due to reversal or cross-coupling effects. We then mapped the results of our aerodynamic study onto a phylogenetic tree of Avialae, using Microraptor (Dromaeosauridae) and Anchiornis (Troodontidae) as outgroups, in order to test whether or not changes in maneuvering characteristics correlated with changes in morphology during early bird evolution. We specifically examined the performance effects of the shortening of the tail and control effectiveness of leg and tail plumage compared to that of the forelimb wing. We also briefly examined similar trends in the pterosaurs and bats, which also appear to show reduction in tails in derived forms. Our analysis offers a biomechanical perspective to the evolution of avian flight that integrates morphological evidence from fossils with modeled performance in a phylogenetic framework.

A major EU project designed to find ways of closing the health gap between the member states, included the first ever comparison of smoking prevalence between these countries using a methodology that minimises potential biases.\\n\\nMETHODS: A detailed analysis of methods and data from the most recent nationwide studies was conducted in the adult population of 27 countries of the European Union and Russia as an external comparator. To maximise comparability, daily smoking in the age range 20-64 was used. Prevalence of current daily smoking, former smoking and never smoking were age-standardised and calculated separately for males and females.\\n\\nFINDINGS: The European map of smoking prevalence shows that male smoking prevalence is much higher in the new than the old members of the EU, whereas in females the reverse is true, but there are also very large differences in smoking rates between particular countries within the same region. Sweden clearly has the lowest prevalence, and the prevalence in the United Kingdom (UK) at the time of the surveys emerges as near the average for old-Europe but higher than, for example, Ireland.\\n\\nINTERPRETATION: Restricting the analysis to daily smokers aged 20-64 produces a map of Europe in which variation in prevalence between individual countries within regions is as important as variation across regions. Survey methods need to be harmonised across countries to enable comparisons involving all ages and non-daily as well as daily smokers.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "22742786", "issn": "1898-2263"}, "source": "Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM", "authors": [{"first_name": "Witold", "last_name": "Zato\u0144ski"}, {"first_name": "Krzysztof", "last_name": "Przewo\u017aniak"}, {"first_name": "Urszula", "last_name": "Sulkowska"}, {"first_name": "Robert", "last_name": "West"}, {"first_name": "Andrzej", "last_name": "Wojty\u0142a"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/tobacco-smoking-countries-european-union", "year": 2012, "keywords": ["Adult", "Europe", "Europe: epidemiology", "European Union", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Smoking", "Smoking: epidemiology", "Young Adult"], "type": "journal", "id": "f2b054b6-ffd2-3714-a762-bb08d2daaa12"}, {"title": "Population Ageing in the United Kingdom, its Constituent Countries and the European Union", "abstract": "Key points \u2022 The UK population is ageing and is projected to continue ageing over the next few decades with the fastest population increases in the numbers of those aged 85 and over. \u2022 Of the four UK constituent countries, Wales was consistently the most aged between 1985 and 2010, with the highest median age and the highest proportion of people aged 65 and over in its population.

Since launching its first sex ed program during World War I, the Public Health Service has dominated federal sex education efforts. Alexandra M. Lord draws on medical research, news reports, the expansive records of the Public Health Service, and interviews with former surgeons general to examine these efforts, from early initiatives through the administration of George W. Bush. Giving equal voice to many groups in America-middle class, working class, black, white, urban, rural, Christian and non-Christian, scientist and theologian-Lord explores how federal officials struggled to create sex education programs that balanced cultural and public health concerns. She details how the Public Health Service left an indelible mark on federally and privately funded sex education programs through partnerships and initiatives with community organizations, public schools, foundations, corporations, and religious groups. In the process, Lord explains how tensions among these organizations and local, state, and federal officials often exacerbated existing controversies about sexual behavior. She also discusses why the Public Health Service's promotional tactics sometimes inadvertently fueled public fears about the federal government's goals in promoting, or not promoting, sex education.

In the Ottoman-Turkish polity, the military has always occupied a privileged place and played a crucial role in the politi-cal system. Not only was the Ottoman state organized as a warrior state, but the military was also both an object and (especially in the nineteenth century) a primary agent of the modernization process. 2 The present composition of the army as a mix of professionals and nonprofessionals also has its roots in the distant past. Beginning about 1000 CE, the Turkish military has always been a mixed system with a minority of core professionals and a majority of nonprofessionals. Such a pattern of composition continues today, but in recent times the core of professionals has grown larger while the body of conscripts has been reduced. This trend toward professionalization took off in the early 1990s, when the Turkish Army, Navy, Air Force, and Gendarmerie were given the green light to boost their ranks with more officers, noncommissioned officers (NCOs), and specialists, and to reduce their reliance on con-scripts\u2014particularly in job positions that require extensive training. The four services of the Turkish Armed Forces have reached varying levels of professionalization. In the navy and the air force, one-half of the personnel are professionals, but in the army and the gendarmerie the professional-to-conscript ratio is still around one to six. Thus the navy and the air force have come a long way in professionalization, and appar-ently have been successful in departing from the historical pattern of a small core of professionals and a large body of conscripts. On the other hand, the army and the gendarmerie, while going along in the trend to-ward professionalization, still have a large body of conscripts. Of course, professionalization brings with it a range of recruitment-related issues. Shortages may occur in times of a robust economy that offers good job opportunities to young people. There is also a question whether recruitment would be (negatively) affected in times of height-ened casualty risk. With regard to the latter issue, the Turkish military is a very interesting case. In has relatively recent and ample experience with military operations, ranging from full-fledged war to present-day peace-keeping. We analyze this experience in some detail, especially with an eye to the toll it has taken in the lives of soldiers. We also interpret available statistics for indications of professionals' and conscripts' will-ingness to \" volunteer for risk. \" In a concluding section we come back to the developing personnel profile of the armed forces. First, however, we examine the central place of military service in Turkish culture. In our view, the status of the draft and of (conscripted) soldiers should be looked upon as the prime token of the kind of martial society Turkey always has been and still is. Only against this background can we really understand Turkish civil-military relations and its relatively high degree of tolerance for casualties. The following observation from a foreigner on the Turkish people's view of its military is revealing: All young Turkish men must serve in the army, which means that virtually every adult male is a veteran and that most fami-lies have had the experience of seeing sons in uniform. Turks do not fear their army or consider it oppressive, the way terri-fied Africans and Latin Americans did when cruel military dic-tatorships dominated their societies. Most see it as a benevolent force that has successfully defended Turkey against foreign and domestic enemies, and that truly has the national interest at heart. In much of Turkish society there is a desire to believe the best about the armed forces and their commanders. 3", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-25644453482", "issn": "0095-327X", "doi": "10.1177/0095327X0503100407"}, "source": "Armed Forces & Society", "authors": [{"first_name": "A.

The Royal Naval Air Service invested heavily in aircraft of all types-aeroplanes, seaplanes, airships, and kite balloons-in order to counter the German U-boats. Under the Royal Air Force, the air campaign against U-boats continued uninterrupted. Aircraft bombed German U-boat bases in Flanders, conducted area and 'hunting' patrols around the coasts of Britain, and escorted merchant convoys to safety. Despite the fact that aircraft acting alone destroyed only one U-boat during the war, the overall contribution of naval aviation to foiling U-boat attacks was significant. Only five merchant vessels succumbed to submarine attack when convoyed by a combined air and surface escort during World War I. This book examines aircraft and weapons technology, aircrew training, and the aircraft production issues that shaped this campaign. Then, a close examination of anti-submarine operations-bombing, patrols, and escort-yields a significantly different judgment from existing interpretations of these operations. This study is the first to take an objective look at the writing and publication of the naval and air official histories as they told the story of naval aviation during the Great War. The author also examines the German view of aircraft effectiveness, through German actions, prisoner interrogations, official histories, and memoirs, to provide a comparative judgment. The conclusion closes with a brief narrative of post-war air anti-submarine developments and a summary of findings. Overall, the author concludes that despite the challenges of organization, training, and production the employment of aircraft against U-boats was largely successful during the Great War. This book will be of interest to historians of naval and air power history, as well as students of World War I and military history in general. \u00a9 2006 John J. Abbatiello.

Uncle Sam Wants You tells the gripping story of the American homefront in World War I, revealing how the tensions of mass mobilization led to a significant increase in power in Washington. Christopher Capozzola shows how, in the absence of a strong federal government, Americans at first mobilized society by stressing duty, obligation, and responsibility over rights and freedoms. In clubs, schools, churches, and workplaces, Americans governed each other. But the heated temper of war quickly unleashed coercion on an unprecedented scale, making wartime America the scene of some of the nation's most serious political violence, including notorious episodes of outright mob violence. To solve this problem, Americans turned over increasing amounts of power to state institutions. In the end, whether they were some of the four million men drafted under the Selective Service Act or the tens of millions of homefront volunteers--or counted themselves among the thousands of conscientious objectors, anti-war radicals, or German enemy aliens--Americans of the World War I era created a new American state, and new ways of being American citizens.

Various real-time 3D rendering techniques have been developed that provide technical fundamentals for the design and implementation of new geovisualization strategies, systems, and environments. These key techniques include multi-resolution modeling, multi-texturing, dynamic texturing, programmable shading, and multi-pass rendering. They lead to significant improvements in visual expressiveness and interactivity in geovisualization systems. Their complex implementation requires encapsulated, re-usable, and extensible components as critical elements to their success and shapes the software architecture of geovisualization systems and applications. Geovisualization is migrating into many application domains as a ubiquitous element of software-intensive systems and their user interfaces due to the broad diffusion of geographic data. Car navigation systems, facility management and control systems, and location-based services providing digital maps on mobile devices represent just a few examples of widely spread uses of geovisualization. As an independent discipline, real-time 3D computer graphics has become a major field in Computer Science and media due its applications in diverse fields such as virtual reality, video games, computer-aided design, and the film and printing industries. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.", "identifiers": {"doi": "10.1016/B978-008044531-1/50434-6", "isbn": "9780080445311 (ISBN)"}, "source": "Exploring Geovisualization", "authors": [{"first_name": "J", "last_name": "D\u00f6llner"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/geovisualization-realtime-3d-computer-graphics-8", "year": 2005, "type": "book_section", "id": "cd9d29d9-9232-3d2a-802a-35ab75b26f4e"}, {"title": "Project 3: Union Jacks.", "abstract": "Discusses the debut Jamie Oliver British-themed restaurant 'Union Jacks' located in the Renzo Piano-designed Central St Giles building in Holborn, designed by London-based design agency Blacksheep.

Although 50% of the photosensitive patients are also sensitive to a 50-Hz television, nonphotosensitive patients with a history of video-game seizures were described as well. The question arises whether this is a mere coincidence, provoked by fatigue and stress, is related to the reaction to the television screen itself, or depends on the movement and color of the pictures of this specific game. A European study was performed in four countries and five sites. All patients were selected because of a history of television, video- or computer-game seizures, with a history of sun-light-, discotheque-, or black and white pattern-evoked seizures, or were already known to be sensitive to intermittent photic stimulation. A total of 387 patients were investigated; 220 (75%) were female and 214 (55%) of those were < 18 years of age. After a routine examination, intermittent photic, pattern, and television stimulation were performed in a standardized way. The patients were investigated with Super Mario World and a standard relatively nonprovocative TV program, both on a 50- and 100-Hz television. Regardless of the distance, Super Mario World proved to be more provocative than the standard program (Wilcoxon, p < 0.05). Eighty-five percent showed epileptiform discharges evoked by intermittent photic stimulation. Forty-five percent of patients were 50-Hz television sensitive and 26% were 100-Hz television sensitive. Pattern sensitivity was found in 28% of patients. The patients, referred because of a television, video- or computer-game seizure, were significantly more sensitive to pattern and to the 50-Hz television (chi square, p < 0.001). More patients are sensitive when playing Super Mario, compared with the standard program (Wilcoxon, p = 0.001) and more sensitive with playing versus viewing (p = 0.016).

Today, the video game arcade persists as a nostalgic space, an entertainment gimmick, or a nerd mecca for the truly dedicated. The history of gaming as practice critically illuminates the evolution of a set of cultural beliefs that have become central in the digital age. As the wired generation transitions to the wireless generation, and as digital natives become dominant cultural elites, we are seeing the refinement of values and ideals readily observed in the arcade culture of the 1970s and 1980s. Ideas about gaming formed prior to the Crash have, like the industry, survived and propagated, and continue to influence popular conceptions of youth, masculinity, and technology; to understand these is to go a long way toward understanding the underpinnings of contemporary digital culture. The video game arcade provided early exposure to computer technologies for thousands of youth years before computers became commonplace in offices, classrooms, and homes across the United States. The arcade may persist in some permutations as a physical space, but more significantly, it persists as a mode not only of play, but of economic decision making and a set of cultural values. The values of the arcade have become the values of our daily lives, including our labor practices and financial habits. In some ways, we are still in the arcade. This essay presents a phenomenological tour of an imagined golden era arcade. I draw on documentation of actual arcades and surviving arcade cabinets, popular press coverage of games and gamers, and interviews with arcade owners and gamers. The tour is presented as a way of entering into a discussion about the meaning of the arcade as a place where computers became culture, boys became men, and simulation became a way of living. We travel through this imagined space not by placing one foot in front of another, shedding quarters along the way, fueled by candy and Funyuns, but instead, by moving from concept to concept, exploring the arcade's key components: sight, sound, and play. The arcade as imagined here is itself a memorial to the modern era and a map to the postmodern age we have come to know as the present, a place we have been and still are. To walk through the arcade is to confront the digitization of culture, including significant changes to the role of money in daily life. This treatment of the arcade provides unique insights into the values system of the arcade itself. Rather than analyzing individual games, this essay offers a phenomenological reading of the machines as objects, specifically as toys with didactic implications, and of the cultural and economic environment that they existed in-both the immediate geographic environment of the arcade and the historically and nationally defined environment of the United States from the early 1970s through the early 1980s. The tour is followed with a consideration of the underlying business structure of the arcade, offering historical perspective on the development of video gaming as a public commercial practice that involved not only the individual gamer consumers, but those who worked in and around the industry. Early video gaming was a set of consumer practices, but it also involved the production, marketing, and distribution of the machines, which influenced the format of the games and shaped the consumer behaviors essential to the games' early success. Although the coin-operated amusement industry was nothing new, the craze triggered by video games was somewhat unique. The vitriolic response many moral guardians had to the games tied not only to the young age of many gamers and the novelty of the medium, but also to the longer history of coin-operated amusements and the parallels between the economic and cultural values of these new games and greater socioeconomic upheaval. Video gaming then, was a site where old worries about youths' access to commercial entertainments coupled with anxieties about emergent technologies and broader cultural and economic shifts. However, this discussion of the arcade as a historical site requires an understanding of the arcade as a physical site. \u00a9 2012 by Wayne State University Press.

Unfortunately, outcomes from these strategies have been mixed, with few instances where significant improvements in product yield have been achieved. This article reviews and contrasts many of the engineering strategies attempted to date, highlighting the variability and context specificity in outcome. The paper argues that this is a reflection of the complexity of mammalian cells, and that a deeper understanding of the biology underpinning protein production for biotechnological purposes is required.

In this investigation, NaHCO3 was added to the AC component and the effects of added NaHCO3 on cement-setting behavior and on set mass were studied as an initial step for the fabrication of AC, which can be replaced with bone faster than current AC. When NaHCO3 was added to AC, the resultant set mass contained CO3. Although not all CO3 was incorporated in the set AC, the amount of CO3 incorporated into the set AC increased with the amount of added NaHCO3. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer measurements revealed the formation of B-type CO3-AP. The setting time measured in an incubator at 37 degreesC acid 100% relative humidity slowed from 30 to 45 min, indicating that NaHCO3 has an inhibitory effect on AP formation. The diametral tensile strength of the set AC decreased significantly with the addition of NaHCO3. Scanning electron microscopic observation revealed that fine crystals were formed in the set AC when NaHCO3 was added to AC. As a result, the crystallinity indices of the set AC measured using X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy decreased with an increase in the amount of added NaHCO3. The dissolution rate of set AC in weak acid, pH 5.5, increased with the amount of added NaHCO3. We concluded that the formation of B-type CO3-AP and the resulting faster dissolution of set AC in weak acidic solution is preferable for the faster replacement of set AC with bone even though the decreased diametral tensile strength value is a shortcoming.

Results show that challenge and frustration can be predicted with a high accuracy (77.77% and 88.66% respectively) via a simple single-neuron model whereas model accuracy for fun (69.18%) suggests the use of more complex non-linear approximators for this emotion.

Individual players often have characteristic styles when playing the game, and this method attempts to find the behaviours which make them unique. During play sessions of Super Mario we calculate player's behaviour policies and reward functions by applying inverse reinforcement learning to the player's actions in game. We conduct an online questionnaire which displays two video clips, where one is played by a human expert and the other is played by the designed controller based on the player's policy.

As the final stages of lobbying took place, speculation in the Mexican newspapers reached fever pitch. Some sounded a note of caution, reflecting that Mexico City had reached this stage on two previous occasions only to return empty-handed. Furthermore, concerns over the high altitude and Mexico's ability to afford the games counted heavily against its chances of success. Trying to second-guess which way members might vote became an integral part of the frenzied excitement. Colonial allegiances swayed African delegates towards Lyon but, surely, as one of the Spanish-speaking candidates, Mexico City could expect its fair share of support from Latin America. Striking an optimistic note, El National noted that the Mexican bidding team was becoming increasingly confident that its lobbying was having an effect. Indeed, the paper took heart from a story that the wives of IOC delegates were said to favour Mexico City: 'It is rumoured by one wife that she and the other wives do not kiss their husbands goodnight without whispering the name \"Mexico\" in their ears.' With such support, how could Mexico lose? Yet when the IOC announced the results of the first round of voting It still took the world by surprise: Buenos Aires 2, Lyon 12, Detroit 14 and Mexico City 30. Such was the margin of Mexico City's victory that a second round was not needed. Not only would the 1968 games be coming to Latin America for the first time but it would also be hosted by the first underdeveloped country in modern Olympic history.

All the above does not mean that Coubertin designed the ideal concept of the modern Olympism and that it is impossible to find statutes that deserve the critical attitude. It is, for example, exaggeration of the role of education and training in solution of social issues, taking into account the influence of only subjective factors on the social significance of sport, the negative attitude to women's participation in Olympic sport, his controversial stance on the issue of the relationship of sport and politics. Today the task that he has always faced, but now it is getting more urgent, is on the front of the Olympic movement: to achieve ultimately complete and effective implementation in sport and via sport of specific universal humanistic values, so that sport, sports competitions, relationship, contacts were used purely for humanitarian purposes, contributed to the humanization of human relations and humanistic development of the personality.", "identifiers": {"issn": "00403601"}, "source": "Teoriya i Praktika Fizicheskoy Kultury", "authors": [{"first_name": "V.

Although this sport was not incorporated in the ancient Olympic games (it did not exist then) the organizers of the 1896 Olympics included it in the Games' program as one of the major events. In a modified form gymnastics has maintained this position until the present day. The Olympic gymnastic events took place at the Panathinaikon Stadium, filled up with spectators, according to the rules that had been set up by the Greek Committee, presided over by I. Fokianos, and based on the German gymnastic system. There were two athletic disciplines: synchronized team performance at the parallel and horizontal bars; and individual performance at the rings, vaulting-horse, pommel horse, horizontal bar, parallel bars, as well as a rope climbing event. Winners in most events were German athletes, who led by Professor Gehbhardt, took part in the games despite the negative and intolerant attitude expressed by the German Gymnastic Federation. The athletes from the host country achieved success as well in winning two first, two second and two third places. Certainly, the gold medal in the rings was celebrated with most enthusiasm, due to the fact that it was the first Greek victory at the stadium. The great success of the gymnastic competition and the first Olympic Games in general contributed decisively to the spread of this sport in Greece and the rest of the world. An equally important part it played in the spread of sports, physical education, and stabilization of the panhuman ancient Greek statute.

Introduction This paper addresses the relationship between elite athlete performance and engagement in higher education. This is an increasingly important issue as the demands placed on elite athletes in general and Olympic athletes in particular have continued to intensify (Conzelmann & Nagel, 2003 ), while at the same time the prerequisites for careers in terms of formal educational and vocational qualifications in many countries have also experienced \u2018creeping credentialism\u2019 (Brown, 1995; Groot & Maassen van den Brink, 2000). Credentialism limits access to certain career paths to those with specific types of qualification and / or experience. Such a context places increasing pressure on young athletes in particular who may be forced to choose between maximising their sporting potential and maximising or even simply \u2018satisficing\u2019 their educational performance in order to prepare for transition into a post-athletic career (Lavallee & Wylleman, 2000). The IOC has recognised the need to promote good practice in this area in its introduction of the IOC Athlete Career Programme, an initiative which is also reflected at national level in a number of cases (such as the British Olympic Association\u2019s launching of its Athlete Career Programme in 2010). Addressing this problem requires the engagement of a range of stakeholders: from sport, athletes, coaches, National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs), youth development bodies from professional sport such as football or rugby academies; from education, universities, , schools and other providers; and from government, both national (ministries with responsibility for education, Youth and Sport) and in some instances transnational bodies (the European Union). Thus the complexity of the institutional infrastructure represents a challenge for those who wish to defend the educational rights of young elite sportsmen and sportswomen. The analysis developed in this paper will draw on the findings of four studies, three completed (Amara, Aquilina, Henry, & PMP Consultants, 2004; Aquilina, 2009; Aquilina, Argent, & Henry, 2005) and one currently in process (an on-going review of Performance Lifestyle initiatives with UK Sport and the English Institute of Sport). Each of these studies \uf02a Paper written in the framework of the IOC\u2019s OSC Postgraduate Grant Selection Committee (2010 meeting)Page | 2 relates wholly or substantially to the elite sport-education relationship. 1 Our commentary for the purposes of this paper will relate principally to the relationship between the demands of elite sport and of higher education. Although each of the studies is limited to analysis of elite sport-education relationships in a European or a British context, there are generic lessons which might be learned from a focus on these contexts. The structure of what follows then will deal with the three following sets of issues. \uf0b7 What are individual nation-states and their educational institutions doing in relation to ensuring that elite athletes may maintain access to educational opportunities? How can their different approaches be characterised? \uf0b7 Why do many athletes choose to maintain an educational career while still striving to perform at the highest level? To what extent are these activities antipathetic or complementary? \uf0b7 What should be the role (and what are the rights and responsibilities) of the key stakeholders in the elite sport-higher education sectors (governments, universities, athletes, national federations etc.)?", "authors": [{"first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Henry"}], "source": "International Olympic Committee Document", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/elite-athletes-higher-education-lifestyle-balance-managment-sporting-educational-performance", "year": 2010, "type": "journal", "id": "eaa3c4f7-7d18-3884-b991-cd1dd1c8d36f"}, {"title": "What was Pierre de Coubertin concerned about in 1889? A View from an Argentine Contemporary Source.", "abstract": "For more than a century Baron Pierre de Coubertin was believed to be a self-inspired Olympic forebear. That idea has recently been challenged, most notably by historian David Young. According to Young, de Coubertin took the idea of international Olympic Games in modern times from W. P. Brookes. Young bases his case on new evidence found in the Brookes\u2019s archives. In this article I present another piece of evidence helping to corroborate Brookes\u2019s influence on de Coubertin\u2019s work. Such evidence comes from the personal report of Alejo Peyret, a member of the Argentine delegation to the 1889 Paris Universal Exposition in which de Coubertin hosted the International Congress for the Propagation of Physical Exercise. In his report, Peyret provided a detailed account of all of the activities of the congress and commented on the state of physical education in France. By analyzing Peyret\u2019s report, this article concludes that in mid-1889 de Coubertin was not concerned with reviving the Olympic Games. His focus was on improving France\u2019s poor physical training system. This article also discusses the impact that the Argentine participation in the congress had on its incipient physical education and sporting movements.

Literature describing the development of sport psychology has discussed a series of essays published by Pierre de Coubertin in 1913 titled Essais de Psychologie Sportive (Cratty, 1989) and the first sport psychology congress, the Congress of Psychology and Physiology of Sports held in 1913 (Silva, 2002). Although the Congress of Psychology and Physiology of Sports has been briefly discussed, little has been presented in the sport psychology literature about the organization and events of the congress. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to describe the work and influence of Pierre de Coubertin on the development of the field of sport psychology. First, Pierre de Coubertin's writings related to the psychological aspects of sport are presented. Next, Olympic Congresses organized by Pierre de Coubertin are discussed. Specifically, the Congress in Le Havre in 1897 and the International Congress of the Psychology and Physiology of Sport in Lausanne in 1913 are described. Finally, speculation as to how Pierre de Coubertin's work related to sport psychology may have influenced the development of the field in the 1920s through the 1940s is presented.

During this period Rio de Janeiro's mega-event strategy evolved through failed Olympic bids, the hosting of the Pan American Games and the mobilisation of expert knowledge from former hosts and bid committees. However, despite the cumulative learning and the relational nature of the project a more nuanced perspective indicates how the strategy was part and parcel of a marked change in local urban politics, appreciated for the ability to leverage funding and accelerate urban development.

France, the fourth country that conducted atmospheric tests, ended its testing in the atmosphere in 1974. A total of 517 nuclear explosions were carried out in the atmosphere: United Kingdom 21, China 22, France 50, United States 210, and Soviet Union 214. As noted in Chapter 1, the PTBT contains no verification provisions. There might be several reasons for that: explosions in the atmosphere are generally easy to detect, and national monitoring equipment, such as for atmospheric radionuclide surveillance, was already available and operational at the time the treaty was signed. The United States launched its satellite-based Vela project in 1963 to monitor atmospheric nuclear explosions, as discussed under national technical means (NTM) below. The three depositories of the PTBT were also ready to move testing underground to reduce radioactive fall-out and thereby also the information that other states might obtain from analyzing the fall-out.", "identifiers": {"doi": "10.1007/978-94-007-16", "isbn": "978-94-007-1676-6"}, "source": "Detect and Deter: Can countries Verify the Nuclear Test Ban?", "authors": [{"first_name": "United", "last_name": "States"}, {"first_name": "Soviet", "last_name": "Union"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/monitoring-atmospheric-nuclear-explosions", "year": 2011, "type": "book_section", "id": "1ea802dc-a03f-3fac-b513-8da6bf02fd8f"}, {"title": "Military Spending in the United States, Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China", "abstract": "Military expenditures of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China are examined from two perspectives: (1) a modification of the traditional Richardson arms race formulation and (2) the notion that the military budget is used by decision makers, in part, to respond to the domestic political and economic environment. These competing formulations are juxtaposed in an empirical analysis of their relevance for understanding contemporary arms allocation decisions. The empirical evaluation of these processes is informed by a critical appraisal of alternative assessments of military allocations, as reflected in data provided by the Stockholm Institute for Peace Research International, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and William T. Lee, a noted defense analyst. The findings suggest that the arms race formulation is empirically deficient in accounting for the spending patterns of the United States, Soviet Union, and People's Republic of China in the period from 1949 to 1978.

The strategy was to combine the nonadhesive properties of smooth titanium (Ti) surfaces with the differentiative and anti-inflammatory properties of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Machined Ti implant surfaces coated with a layer of EPA, with or without UV irradiation, were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and their in vivo performance was evaluated in New Zealand White rabbits. The performance of the functionalised implants was analyzed after 10 weeks of healing by mechanical pull-out testing, molecular biology, and histological and microcomputed tomography analysis. The results indicate that surface functionalization with UV light can reduce bone attachment and volumetric bone mineral density in the peri-implant bone tissue. The presence of EPA on the surfaces enhanced this effect further. Gene expression of bone formation markers showed a trend toward higher mRNA levels in all EPA treated groups. The histological analyses demonstrated lower inflammation in the UV-irradiated group and immature bone formation in all the groups. In conclusion, surface functionalization of Ti implants with UV light and EPA could be a biocompatible coating for reduced bone bonding ability of Ti while promoting bone formation. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The BdG equations are implemented in real space and then solved self-consistently via exact diagonalization. In the uniform case, we find that the dx2\u2212y2-wave pairing state is most favorable for a nearest-neighbor pairing interaction while the sx2y2-wave pairing state is most favorable for a next-nearest-neighbor pairing interaction, which is consistent with that reported by Seo et al.

Even short-term exposures to SHS, such as those that might be experienced by a patron in a restaurant or bar that allows smoking, can increase the risk of experiencing an acute cardiovascular event. Although population-based data indicate declining SHS exposure in the United States over time, SHS exposure remains a common but preventable public health hazard. Policies requiring smoke-free environments are the most effective method of reducing SHS exposure. Effective July 24, 2003, New York implemented a comprehensive state law requiring almost all indoor workplaces and public places (e.g., restaurants, bars, and other hospitality venues) to be smoke-free. This report describes an assessment of changes in indoor air quality that occurred in 20 hospitality venues in western New York where smoking or indirect SHS exposure from an adjoining room was observed at baseline. The findings indicate that, on average, levels of respirable suspended particles (RSPs), an accepted marker for SHS levels, decreased 84% in these venues after the law took effect.

When both test results are reactive, they indicate present or past infection. However, for economic reasons, some high-volume clinical laboratories have begun using automated treponemal tests, such as automated enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) or immunochemoluminescence tests, and have reversed the testing sequence: first screening with a treponemal test and then retesting reactive results with a nontreponemal test. This approach has introduced complexities in test interpretation that did not exist with the traditional sequence. Specifically, screening with a treponemal test sometimes identifies persons who are reactive to the treponemal test but nonreactive to the nontreponemal test. No formal recommendations exist regarding how such results derived from this new testing sequence should be interpreted, or how patients with such results should be managed. To begin an assessment of how clinical laboratories are addressing this concern, CDC reviewed the testing algorithms used and the test interpretations provided in four laboratories in New York City. Substantial variation was found in the testing strategies used, which might lead to confusion about appropriate patient management. A total of 3,664 (3%) of 116,822 specimens had test results (i.e., reactive treponemal test result and nonreactive nontreponemal test result) that would not have been identified by the traditional testing algorithms, which end testing if the nontreponemal test result is nonreactive.

There are two bodies that issue standards for nonprofits: The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Office of Budget and Management (OMB). The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) also has oversight in auditing of NPOs. Nonprofits are similar to the government in that their mission is to provide services for the public good. Nonprofit organizations are not in business to make money, but rather to provide services with revenue from private donations or federal awards. Because nonprofits receive money through donations, gifts or grants, they are highly accountable to their constituents to show value from their programs and services. Nonprofits vary in size and may or may not have paid staff or access to professional managers or financial advisors. Because of the nature of revenue streams for nonprofits (grants, gifts and memberships) special accounting procedures and financial statements are required; especially if the NPO receives federal money. This essay describes the general requirements for NPO accounting and financial reporting as well as the unique requirements for NPO financial statements.

Both types have been radiologically characterized by diffuse symmetrical osteosclerosis, but with characteristic differences. Increased thickness of the cranial vault is a typical finding in type I ADO, whereas endobones in the pelvis and end-plate thickening in the spine are obligate findings in type II. Eleven patients with type I from three kindreds, and seven patients with type II, one family participated in the study, and were compared with 18 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Whole-body BMC and BMD were measured, and regions of special interest were selected: head, axial, and appendicular skeleton. Moreover, lumbar spine and femoral neck scans were performed. Whole-body BMC and BMD, mostly reflecting cortical bone, were markedly increased in both types compared with normals. A pronounced osteosclerosis was present in the axial as well as the appendicular skeleton. Median BMD was markedly increased in the axial skeleton by 51% (44-56) and 42% (33-56), (median differences with 95% CI), respectively, for types I and II compared to normal controls, and in the appendicular skeleton by 48% (37-59) and 38% (16-45). No overlap between observed ranges of patients and controls was observed. A positive correlation between age and whole-body BMD was demonstrated in ADO, but not in the control group, indicating progressive osteosclerosis with age.

Additionally, the effect of sequential therapy with PTH and the bisphosphonate, risedronate, the effect of longterm PTH monotherapy, and the effect of long-term risedronate monotherapy were assessed. 96 4-month-old rats were randomized into nine groups. Eight groups were ovariectomized and one group was sham operated. 12 months after surgery, treatment regimens were initiated (OW) and were continued for either 2 weeks (2 W) or 12 weeks (12 W). The treatment regimens were as follows: (1) baseline ovx (OW); (2) ovx-saline (2 W); (3) ovx-PTH 1-34 (2 W); (4) intact-saline (12 W); (5) ovx-saline (12 W); (6) ovx-risedronate (12 W); (7) ovx-PTH 1-34 (12 W); (8) ovx-PTH 1-34 (2 W), followed by pause (10 W); and (9) ovx-PTH 1-34 (2 W), accompanied by risedronate (12 W). The effect of therapy (endpoint) was measured at three skeletal sites: vertebral bodies; femoral cortical bone; and femoral necks. The results revealed an anabolic, time-dependent effect of PTH 1-34 at all skeletal sites. No loss of anabolic effect was observed 10 weeks after discontinuation of 2 week PTH treatment in this rat model. Risedronate given in sequential therapy with PTH produced no significant effect on biomechanical properties at any skeletal sites when compared with 2 week PTH followed by a 10 week pause. However, when risedronate was given alone, a positive effect was seen at the vertebral site after a 12 week treatment. On the basis of this study with short-term PTH treatment of aged, osteopenic, ovariectomized rats, there seemed to be a significant effect of PTH on the biomechanical properties and no loss of effect even 10 weeks after PTH withdrawal.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "9145240", "issn": "8756-3282", "doi": "10.1016/S8756-3282(97)00024-0"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "Bone", "last_name": "Vol"}, {"first_name": "Cell", "last_name": "Biology"}, {"first_name": "Key", "last_name": "Words"}, {"first_name": "Lis", "last_name": "Mosekilde"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/loss-biomechanical-effects-after-withdrawal-shortterm-pth-treatment-aged-osteopenic-ovariectomized-r", "year": 1997, "keywords": ["Aging", "Aging: pathology", "Aging: physiology", "Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Bone Diseases", "Bone and Bones", "Bone and Bones: drug effects", "Bone and Bones: physiopathology", "Calcium Channel Blockers", "Calcium Channel Blockers: administration & dosage", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Etidronic Acid", "Etidronic Acid: administration & dosage", "Etidronic Acid: analogs & derivatives", "Female", "Metabolic", "Metabolic: drug therapy", "Metabolic: physiopathology", "Ovariectomy", "Ovary", "Ovary: physiology", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Parathyroid Hormone: administration & dosage", "Rats", "Sprague-Dawley", "Time Factors"], "type": "journal", "id": "68eb5b99-767f-36ed-a2db-1ffa24e22b74"}, {"title": "Embryonic Development of Bone and the Molecular Regulation of Intramembranous and Endochondral Bone Formation", "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the developmental biology of the skeleton, the complex array of signals that influence each developmental stage, and discusses various inherited disorders of the skeleton arising from mutant gene products. The skeletal system is multifunctional as it provides the rigid framework and support that gives shape to the body, protects delicate internal organs, endows the body with the capability of movement, acts as the primary storage site for mineral salts, and functions in hematopoiesis. The organization and morphology of the developing skeleton are established through a series of inductive interactions. The functional elements in these inductive and morphogenetic processes are not individual cells, but rather interacting populations that elaborate an extensive extracellular matrix, which in turn feeds back onto these matrix-producing cells and controls their differentiation potential. A variety of human skeletal disorders arises as a consequence of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in signaling pathways involved in mesenchymal condensation. Mutations in GDF5 causes acromesomelic chondrodysplasia and Hunter-Thompson type, which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by short forearms, hands and feet, and very short metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges. Mutations in GDF5 have also been reported in patients with Grebe-type chondrodysplasia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe limb shortening, and dysmorphogenesis with a proximal-distal gradient of severity. Intramembranous bone formation is achieved by the direct transformation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts. The composite structure of the mammalian skull requires precise prenatal and postnatal growth regulation of individual calvarial elements, and disturbances of this process frequently cause severe clinical manifestations in humans. The mutated forms of homeobox genes MSX1 and MSX2 are associated with human craniofacial disorders such as autosomal dominant form of hypodontia and parietal foramina respectively.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "11336917", "issn": "87563282", "isbn": "9780123706157", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-373884-4.00025-2"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "J.", "last_name": "Benoit, ST.; Hellms"}, {"first_name": "A.", "last_name": "Karaplis"}, {"first_name": "John F.", "last_name": "Kay"}, {"first_name": "John S.", "last_name": "Torday"}, {"first_name": "Atsuhiko", "last_name": "Hikita"}, {"first_name": "Tadahiro", "last_name": "Iimura"}, {"first_name": "Yusuke", "last_name": "Oshima"}, {"first_name": "Takashi", "last_name": "Saitou"}, {"first_name": "Shin", "last_name": "Yamamoto"}, {"first_name": "Takeshi", "last_name": "Imamura"}, {"first_name": "Robert E.", "last_name": "Marx"}, {"first_name": "C.", "last_name": "Kleinhans"}, {"first_name": "F.F.

We hypothesised that compared to controls, gymnasts would have larger and stronger radius and tibia diaphyses with greater bone mineral content and larger cross-sectional muscle area. At the distal metaphyseal sites of the radius and tibia, gymnasts would have greater bone cross-sectional area and total and trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD). Differences between the lumbar spine, total body and body composition in gymnasts versus controls were also studied. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) was used to measure bone geometry, density and muscle of the peripheral skeleton; dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for total body and axial measurements. Eighty-six pre-pubertal children, 44 gymnasts (mean age 9.0 years, range 5.4-11.9 years) and 42 controls (mean age 8.8 years, range 5.6-11.9 years) were studied. Eighty-four children were Caucasian, one child was mixed race, one Chinese. Data were adjusted for age, sex and height. Differences in the effect size between sexes were also tested. At the 50% radius diaphysis gymnasts had larger bones (9.2%, p = 0.0054) with greater cortical area (8.2%, p = 0.022) and stress strain index (surrogate measure of bone strength) than controls (13.6%, p = 0.015). The effect size was different between males and females for cortical thickness (p = 0.03). At the 65% tibia diaphysis, gymnasts had greater cortical area (5.3%, p = 0.057) and thickness (6.2%, p = 0.068) than controls; consequently, bone strength was 5.4% higher (p = 0.14). There were no significant differences in cortical volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at the radius or tibia diaphysis between the groups. There was a difference in effect size for tibia muscle cross-sectional area between the sexes (p = 0.035). At the distal radius and tibia total and trabecular vBMD was greater (Total: radius 17%, p < 0.0001, tibia: 5.7%, p = 0.0053; trabecular: radius 21%, p < 0.0001, tibia 4.5%, p = 0.11).

Likewise, total body BMD (3.5%, p = 0.0057) and BMC (4.78%, p = 0.085) were greater in gymnasts but there were no differences in skeletal size. These data suggest site-specific differences in how the pre-pubertal skeleton develops in response to the repetitive loading it experiences when participating in regular gymnastics. At diaphyseal sites these differences are predominantly in the bone and muscle geometry and not density. Conversely, at trabecular sites, the differences are increased density rather than geometry. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated skeletal differences between gymnasts and controls. These differences appear to be site and sex specific.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "15876561", "issn": "8756-3282", "isbn": "87563282", "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2005.03.001"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "KA", "last_name": "Ward"}, {"first_name": "SA", "last_name": "Roberts"}, {"first_name": "J E", "last_name": "Adams"}, {"first_name": "M Z", "last_name": "Mughal"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/bone-geometry-density-skeleton-prepubertal-gymnasts-school-children", "year": 2005, "keywords": ["Absorptiometry", "Body Height", "Body Height: physiology", "Body Mass Index", "Body Weight", "Body Weight: physiology", "Bone Density", "Bone Density: physiology", "Bone Development", "Bone Development: physiology", "Bone and Bones", "Bone and Bones: anatomy & histology", "Child", "Female", "Gymnastics", "Gymnastics: physiology", "Humans", "Male", "Photon", "Radius", "Radius: anatomy & histology", "Sex Factors", "Spine", "Spine: anatomy & histology", "Tibia", "Tibia: anatomy & histology", "Tomography", "X-Ray Computed"], "type": "journal", "id": "27eef7b7-a7d0-3aec-acfe-ba280581aa8d"}, {"title": "Denosumab, a fully human RANKL antibody, reduced bone turnover markers and increased trabecular and cortical bone mass, density, and strength in ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys", "abstract": "Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANKL, a protein essential for osteoclast formation, function, and survival. Osteoclast inhibition with denosumab decreased bone resorption, increased bone mineral density (BMD), and reduced fracture risk in osteoporotic women. The effects of 16months of continuous osteoclast inhibition on bone strength parameters were examined in adult ovariectomized (OVX) cynomolgus monkeys (cynos). One month after surgery, OVX cynos (n=14-20/group) were treated monthly with subcutaneous vehicle (OVX-Veh) or denosumab (25 or 50mg/kg). Sham-operated controls were treated with vehicle (n=17). OVX-Veh exhibited early and persistent increases in the resorption marker CTx, followed by similar increases in the formation marker BSAP, consistent with increased bone remodeling. Denosumab reduced CTx and BSAP throughout the study to levels significantly lower than in OVX-Veh or Sham-Veh, consistent with reduced remodeling. Increased remodeling in OVX-Veh led to absolute declines in areal BMD of 4.3-7.4% at the lumbar spine, total hip, femur neck, and distal radius (all p<0.05 vs baseline). Denosumab significantly increased aBMD at each site to levels exceeding baseline or OVX-Veh controls, and denosumab significantly increased cortical vBMC of the central radius and tibia by 7% and 14% (respectively) relative to OVX-Veh. Destructive biomechanical testing revealed that both doses of denosumab were associated with significantly greater peak load for femur neck (+19-34%), L3-L4 vertebral bodies (+54-55%), and L5-L6 cancellous cores (+69-82%) compared with OVX-Veh. Direct assessment of bone tissue material properties at cortical sites revealed no significant changes with denosumab. For all sites analyzed biomechanically, bone mass (BMC) and strength (load) exhibited strong linear correlations (r \\n                        2=0.59-0.85 for all groups combined). Denosumab did not alter slopes of load-BMC regressions at any site, and denosumab groups exhibited similar or greater load values at given BMC values compared with OVX-Veh or Sham. In summary, denosumab markedly reduced biochemical markers of bone remodeling and increased cortical and trabecular bone mass in adult OVX cynos. Denosumab improved structural bone strength parameters at all sites analyzed, and strength remained highly correlated with bone mass. There was no evidence for reduced material strength properties of cortical bone with denosumab over this time period, which approximates to 4years of remodeling in the slower-remodeling adult human skeleton. These data indicate that denosumab increased bone strength by increasing bone mass and preserving bone quality. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "21497676", "issn": "87563282", "isbn": "1873-2763 (Electronic)\\r1873-2763 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2011.04.001"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "Michael S.", "last_name": "Ominsky"}, {"first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Stouch"}, {"first_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "Schroeder"}, {"first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Pyrah"}, {"first_name": "Marina", "last_name": "Stolina"}, {"first_name": "Susan Y.", "last_name": "Smith"}, {"first_name": "Paul J.", "last_name": "Kostenuik"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/denosumab-fully-human-rankl-antibody-reduced-bone-turnover-markers-increased-trabecular-cortical-bon", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["Bone quality", "Bone strength", "Cortical bone", "Denosumab", "Osteoporosis"], "type": "journal", "id": "4bdd93a9-2691-3621-a192-163c7316513c"}, {"title": "How B cells influence bone biology in health and disease", "abstract": "It is now well established that important regulatory interactions occur between the cells in the hematopoietic, immune and skeletal systems (osteoimmunology).

The slope of the regression for human vertebral cancellous bone ultimate strength predicted by stiffness was not statistically different from similar regressions for cortical bone in tension in either a bovine sample or in published data from multiple species.

Osteopetrosis (op) and incisors absent (ia) are two nonallelic mutations in the rat which demonstrated these skeletal defects as a result of reduced bone resorption. Osteopetrotic (op) rats have severe sclerosis as a result of reduced numbers of osteoclasts which are structurally abnormal. The sclerosis in ia rats is not as severe as in op mutants; they have elevated numbers of osteoclasts, but they are also morphologically abnormal, lacking a ruffled border. Both of these mutations have defects in the inflammation-primed activation of macrophages. They demonstrate independent defects in the cascade involved in the conversion of vitamin D binding protein (DBP) to a potent macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF). Because this factor may also play a role in the pathogenesis of osteoclastic dysfunction, the effects of ex vivo-generated DBP-MAF were evaluated on the skeletal system of these two mutations. Newborn ia and op rats and normal littermate controls were injected with DBP-MAF or vehicle once every 4 days from birth until 2 weeks of age, at which time bone samples were collected to evaluate a number of skeletal parameters.

Both may contribute to serum bone formation markers although they have an opposite effect on bone fragility. The aim of this study was to determine if circulating bone formation markers reflect periosteal bone formation and endosteal bone remodelling in 640 men aged 55-85 years belonging to the MINOS cohort. We measured biochemical markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, N-terminal extension propeptide of type I collagen) and bone resorption (urinary and serum beta-isomerised C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I, total and free deoxypyridinoline). Parameters of bone size (cross-sectional surface of third lumbar vertebral body measured by X-ray, projected areas of total hip, femoral neck, radius and ulna measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) increased with age (r = 0.20-0.32, P < 0.0001). In contrast, parameters related to bone loss (areal bone mineral density [aBMD], volumetric bone mineral density [vBMD] and cortical thickness) and determined mainly by bone resorption, decreased with ageing (r = -0.14 to -0.23, P < 0.005-0.0001). Men in the highest quartile of bone resorption markers had lower aBMD (3.8-10.2%, P < 0.05-0.0001), lower vBMD (3.9-13.0%, P < 0.05-0.0001), and lower cortical thickness (1.5-9.6%, P < 0.05-0.0001) than men in the lowest quartile. Markers of bone resorption were not significantly associated with estimates of bone size at any skeletal site. Markers of bone formation were not associated with estimates of periosteal formation after adjustment for covariates. In contrast, men in the highest quartile of the bone formation markers had significantly lower aBMD (4.0-11.7%, P < 0.05-0.0001), lower vBMD (4.2-16.3, P < 0.05-0.0001) and lower cortical thickness (4.0-7.4%, P < 0.05-0.0001) than men in the lowest quartile. In summary, serum levels of bone formation markers are negatively correlated with the estimates of endosteal bone loss. In contrast, they disclose no association with parameters reflecting periosteal apposition. Thus, in elderly men, bone formation markers reflect endosteal bone remodelling, probably because of the coupling between resorption and formation activities. In contrast, they do not reflect the periosteal bone formation, probably because the periosteal surface is smaller and has a slower remodelling rate than the endosteal surface.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "15663998", "issn": "8756-3282", "isbn": "8756-3282 (Print)\\r1873-2763 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2004.09.004"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "P", "last_name": "Szulc"}, {"first_name": "P", "last_name": "Garnero"}, {"first_name": "F", "last_name": "Marchand"}, {"first_name": "F", "last_name": "Duboeuf"}, {"first_name": "P D", "last_name": "Delmas"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/biochemical-markers-bone-formation-reflect-endosteal-bone-loss-elderly-menminos-study", "year": 2005, "keywords": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biological Markers/*metabolism", "Bone Density", "Bone Resorption/*metabolism", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies"], "type": "journal", "id": "f6d74bd6-554e-3e0b-8e43-c4c0c7ef3749"}, {"title": "Evidence for a vertebrate catapult: elastic energy storage in the plantaris tendon during frog jumping", "abstract": "Anuran jumping is one of the most powerful accelerations in vertebrate locomotion. Several species are hypothesized to use a catapult-like mechanism to store and rapidly release elastic energy, producing power outputs far beyond the capability of muscle. Most evidence for this mechanism comes from measurements of whole-body power output; the decoupling of joint motion and muscle shortening expected in a catapult-like mechanism has not been demonstrated. We used high-speed marker-based biplanar X-ray cinefluoroscopy to quantify plantaris muscle fascicle strain and ankle joint motion in frogs in order to test for two hallmarks of a catapult mechanism: (i) shortening of fascicles prior to joint movement (during tendon stretch), and (ii) rapid joint movement during the jump without rapid muscle-shortening (during tendon recoil). During all jumps, muscle fascicles shortened by an average of 7.8 per cent (54% of total strain) prior to joint movement, stretching the tendon. The subsequent period of initial joint movement and high joint angular acceleration occurred with minimal muscle fascicle length change, consistent with the recoil of the elastic tendon. These data support the plantaris longus tendon as a site of elastic energy storage during frog jumping, and demonstrate that catapult mechanisms may be employed even in sub-maximal jumps.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "22090204", "issn": "1744-9561", "isbn": "1744-9561", "doi": "10.1098/rsbl.2011.0982"}, "source": "Biology Letters", "authors": [{"first_name": "H.

These defects involve not only major skeletal discontinuities and endoprosthetic joint replacement, in which the reconstruction is completely covered by biologic tissues, but also situations in which skin or mucous membrane must be penetrated in order to allow attachment of a prosthetic limb or, in craniomaxillofacial defects, a prosthetic replacement. The attachment of a bone-conduction hearing aid to the skull bone is another example requiring skin penetration. In all of these situations, a load-carrying prosthesis must become and remain connected to the skeleton in the defect region in such a manner that the bone tissue is not only capable of carrying the functional loads and shock loading, but also is able to react in a physiological manner to remodel according to the functional loads applied. Different philisophies have formed the basis for numerous methodological approaches to this problem. Most of these approaches provide adequate initial stability; but after shorter or longer periods of time, many end up suffering a loss of stability associated with ingrowth of fibrous tissue and with more or less severe local tissue damage as a consequence of the increasing mobility of the anchoring element. The predominant problem has been that it was considered an inevitable consequence of the presence of a synthetic component in living bone tissue to initiate formation of low-differentiated connective tissue in the biological interface due to the presence of the material itself or to the transferred dynamic load. However, contrary to popular opinion, it has been demonstrated that using a bioacceptable material, such as pure titanium with a specific surface microarchitecture, and a design of the anchorage element that allows controlled transfer of load to the adjacent bone in combination with extremely gentle surgical preparation of the bone site accommodating the titanium component and allowing adequate time for bone healing and remodeling, it is possible to create a situation, where bone tissue incorporates the anchorage securely so it can accept functional demands without mechanical failure or rejection phenomena over very long periods (see Figures 13.1 and 13.2). This principle, which we called osseointegration, was developed as a result of our experimental studies. These started in 1952, when we focused on bone and marrow tissue response to injury, with microvascular disturbance as a sensitive identification factor. Later we performed a detailed evaluation of the interaction between titanium and hard and soft tissues in animals and humans. After the application of screw-shaped titanium components (fixtures) as anchorage elements for prosthetic teeth in dogs with a functional lifetime of up to 10 years, the procedure was first applied clinically in complete edentulism to provide permanent stable support of fixed dental prostheses. Since our clinical pilot cases in 1965, more than 100 000 edentulous patients have been treated to date, and 500 000 fixtures have been installed according to the osseointegration principle. In long-term, consecutive clinical studies, prosthetic stability without undue tissue reactions has been achieved in 99% of lower jaw prostheses and 95% of upper jaw prostheses (Adell 1989). Since 1976, craniomaxillofacial prostheses have been anchored to skull bone via osseointegrated titanium fixtures, and bone-conduction hearing aids have been similarly anchored in the mastoid bone. Titanium elements penetrating skin and mucous membrane following appropriate surgical procedures have functioned well and have not caused significant clinical problems (Tjellstr\u00f6m 1989). Starting in 1981, osseointegration was applied to endoprosthetic repair of finger joints with successive adjustments of designs and surgical procedures. The clinical results indicate that the long-term prognosis expected in hand surgery and orthopedic surgery can be similar to that found in oral and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction. Many publications have been devoted to the basic biology, physics, and chemistry - as well as the clinical procedure and results - of the osseointegration of titanium (Kasemo 1985, Albrektsson 1988). Osseointegration as it applies to provision of permenant and stable connection of a sythetic component to the human skeleton can be defined as follows: A biological response resulting in long-term coexistence of differentiated, remodeling  bone tissue and strictly defined synthetic components, providing lasting, specific clinical functions without initiating rejection mechanisms. This long-termcoexistence implies a tie scale of decades, not merely a few years. Osseointegration as a means of incorporating load-carrying endoprosthesis in the skeleton relies for prognostic predictability on three basic biologic concepts. First, the bone site for the anchoring element must be prepared with a careful and gentle surgical technique so that the wound that is created in the bone can heal with differentiated bone tissue, avoiding formation of any low-differentiated scar or fibrous tissue in the interface. Second, because in many situations the bone tissue is more or less deficient preoperatively because of long periods of inactivity, impaired circulation, and so on, it is important to allow adequate unloaded, undisturbed time for healing until remineralization has occurred. This avoids the risk that load could cause relative movement between prosthesis and adjacent bone. Third, that an immediate and direct contact is established between differentiated bone tissue and synthetic material, and the load transferred from the prosthesis via the interface to the anchoring bone can provide an adequate load-remodeling stimulus within the mechanical capacity of the bone at any particular time (see Figures 13.3 and 13.3). This requirement can be fulfilled only by careful attention to the micro as well as the macro aspects of the design of the fixtures. In most orthopedic reconstructions, the prosthetic components are covered by skin. In craniomaxillofacial situations, however, the majority of cases require penetration of skin or mucous membrane in order to permit mechanical connection of intraoral or extraoral prostheses to the skeleton. That means that in addition to mechanical stability, long-term healthy conditions must be established at locations where the integumentum has been pierced by connectors supporting the prosthesis (see Figure 13.5). In the osseointegration system that we have developed for the craniomaxillofacial region, the fixtures, which are made of commercially pure titanium, have specific geometry and surface characteristics (see Figure 13.6). This design provides to the synthetic components a combination of minimal volume and adequate surface area. In situations where the skin or mucous membrane must be penetrated to accommodate the prosthesis, special surgical, prosthetic, and maintenance requirements should be considered in order to provide a safe, antiseptic clinical procedure and a stable, long-term result (see Figures 13.7 and 13.8). The stability and load-carrying capacity that can be achieved depend on the adaptation and continuous remodeling of the anchoring bone tissue during the early stage of bone healing and on the initial load-carrying period, when a dynamic equilibrium is created at the interface. This is a prerequisite for long-term prognostic predictability (see Figure 13.9). Experimental studies and clinical documentation illustrate anatomical details of successful osseointegration (see Figures 13-10 and 13-11). Osseointegration, in clinical dentistry and in reconstructive craniomaxillofacial surgery, has proven to be a reliable procedure for creating longterm mechanical stability. This includes single tooth replacement, treatment of complete edentulism, treatment of congenital or aquired defects, sometimes requiring bone grafting procedures and prosthetic substitution, as reprinted in our consecutive clinical materials for over two decades (see Figures 13.12 and 13.14). The possibilities and limitations of permanent mechanical stability can be understood only when one regards bone as a complex biological tissue. Bone is composed of living cells and a mineralized ground substance in a special three-dimensional arrangement, with a microvascular system, necessary for the immediate co-existence with the hemopoietic marrow tissue (Figure 13.15). Accordingly, any application of osseointegration in clinical situations must consider, in addition to engineering and mechanical aspects, the biological dynamics and time perspectives involved.", "authors": [{"first_name": "R", "last_name": "Br\u00e5nemark"}, {"first_name": "R", "last_name": "Skalak"}, {"first_name": "P-I.", "last_name": "Br\u00e5nemark"}], "source": "Rigid Fixation of the Craniomaxillofacial Skeleton", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/osteointegration-rigid-fixation", "year": 1992, "type": "book_section", "id": "1a81958b-d1a1-3fb1-976a-0e46306442c6"}, {"title": "Building The Bases For Paleodemographic Analysis: Adult Age Determination", "abstract": "The effort here has been to try to establish viable methods for researchers working with samples large enough to allow reconstruction of population prevalences of age-dependent characters and of paleodemographic parameters. Our concern is to enquire into what is feasible under the conditions prevailing now, and considerations required by comparison of material being studied now with that studied in the past. Because large and representative samples are absolutely necessary in order to make valid statements about the adult age-at-death distribution of past populations, the question of feasibility is basic. One cannot, and should not, section all teeth within a large sample, saw through all long bone proximal ends (Holleman and Cox, 1993; WEAK 1980), or obtain readable thin sections from all femoral cortices, fourth ribs, or clavicles. A consideration here is what can most profitably be done to collect information quickly, accurately, and economically, especially when rebuttal is a possibility.\\nThere must be detailed examination of dentitions, with careful consideration of which teeth might be sacrificed for root sectioning. Standardized photography and radiography of jaws and long bones must be undertaken, and casting of-teeth should be undertaken where reburial is likely. No great advances have been published in recent years on the question of adult agen assessment, and cemental annulation remains the method most likely to restore paleodemography to importance within skeletal biology Work on known age samples has brought light to some dark corners, as has the vast amount of work undertaken by Kemkes-Grottenthaler. The increased interest of skeletal biologists in the use of categorical analyses will provide a new approach, freeing us from feeling coerced into estimating \"ages\" from stages We will use indicator stages, not as age estimators, but as categories of change during adult life, which will provide us with ways to understand how the human skeleton responds to the exigencies of adult life under many circumstances. The lack of age control will be an acknowledged limitation. Where possible, the limitation will be partially alleviated by the provision of a scale through cemental annulations. This scale will be a control for seriation based on detailed analyses of dentitions.", "authors": [{"first_name": "M", "last_name": "Jackes"}], "source": "Biological Anthropology Of The Human Skeleton", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/building-bases-paleodemographic-analysis-adult-age-determination", "year": 2000, "keywords": ["Abrasion", "Adult", "Altersdiagnose", "Altersver\ufffdnderungen", "Anthropology", "Cementochronologie", "Dentition", "Frauen", "Gr\ufffdberfeld", "Histologie", "Human", "Knochen", "Lebenserwartung", "Literatur\ufffdbersicht", "Methode", "Methoden", "Population", "Sch\ufffddeln\ufffdhte", "Zement", "Z\ufffdhne", "age determination", "analysis", "komplexe Methode", "methods", "radiography", "teeth"], "type": "book_section", "id": "4a068fdc-9d64-377c-817a-400ec13b19a9"}, {"title": "Swimming and jumping in a semi-aquatic frog", "abstract": "Locomotion has a clear ecological relevance for many animals.

Clear links have also been found between an animal\u2019s performance and its morphology. A function analysis can unravel the underlying mechanistic facets of this link. Frogs are interesting model species because they add an extra element to this topic; they have to perform in two entirely different physical environments, particularly semi-aquatic species. However, no trade-off was found between jumping and swimming performance. Morphological correlates were found but, to understand causations, a thorough understanding of the mechanics of locomotion is required. When comparing the mechanics of jumping and swimming, the question arises of how to ensure a sound comparison. Ideally, some measure of \u2018effort\u2019 has to be added to the analysis. We suggest the use of the propulsive impulse. Unexpectedly, the impulse of swimming proved to be significantly smaller than the jumping impulses during locomotion in a semi-aquatic frog, Rana esculenta,even when maximal performance had been induced in both media. To verify our impulse calculations, we analysed the external forces during both locomotor modes. The forces during terrestrial locomotion can be measured directly using a force plate; determining the forces in water requires a more complex set-up. For that reason, we performed a DPIV (Digital Particle Image Velocimetry) analysis on the flow generated by swimming frogs.

Instead, we should concern ourselves with whether the potential moral freedom afforded within gamespace is psychologically healthy, for it is our contention that underlying any change to the gamer\u2019s behaviour is the need to seek psychological parity across domains (between gamespace and the offline world).

The main findings of the paper can be summarized as follows: (1) Increases in the probability of apprehension, the conditional probability of incarceration and the sentence are associated with significant reductions in aircraft hijackings in the 1961 to 1976 time period. These findings are based on two methods of estimating the rate of hijackings , a quarterly time series and the time or flight intervals between successive hijackings, and alternative estimates of the deterrence variables. (2) Regression estimates from the sample period ending in 1972 were used to forecast the number of additional hijackings that would have taken place between 1973 and 1976 if (a) mandatory screening had not been instituted and (b) the probability of apprehension (once the hijacking is attempted) had remained constant and equal to its 1972 value. Under these assumptions, there would have been between 41 and 67 additional hijackings compared to the 11 that actually occurred in the 1973 to 1976 period. (3) Although the mandatory screening program is highly effective in terms of the number of hijackings prevented, its costs appear enormous. The estimated net increase in security costs due to the screening program (which does not include the time and inconvenience costs to persons searched) is $194.24 million over the 1973 to 1976 period. This, in turn, translates into a $3.24 to $9.25 million expenditure to deter a single hijacking. Put differently, if the dollar equivalent of the loss to an individual hijacked passenger were in the range of $76,718 to $219,221, then the costs of screening would just offset the expected hijacking losses.", "authors": [{"first_name": "William M", "last_name": "Landes"}], "source": "Journal of Law and Economics,", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/economic-study-aircraft-hijacking-19611976", "year": 1978, "type": "journal", "id": "6f2b6832-a11e-3758-a3f9-5c44f904583e"}, {"title": "Stated preference analysis of a new very light jet based on-demand air service", "abstract": "This paper develops behavior models to analyze traveler propensity towards a new \"very light jet\"-based on-demand air service (ODAS), also labeled air taxi service, with the broader objective of providing guidance for the enabling stakeholders including business operators, policy-makers and aircraft manufacturers. The models predict the probability of individuals switching from their usual preferred mode of intercity transportation (up to 960 km) to the ODAS under a range of scenarios in terms of travel distance and cost. Travel distance, service fare, and level of accessibility are identified as key determinants of the viability of the ODAS. Analysis of the models provides insights for operational/business strategies in the private sector (both for aircraft manufacturers and the ODAS operators), for policy-making in the public sector, and for understanding the potential barriers to the evolution of ODAS as a viable intercity travel option. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The powers of the mind are the immediate conditions of moral life. The phenomena of consciousness are the first field reached by the law of duty. These powers are those of thought, feeling and volition. This is not a progressive series of which the first term is thought, but one rather of expansion on either hand, of which the rootforce is the feelings. This is seen both in the order of development of human powers, and in the impulse which pervades them. The feelings are the first facts in consciousness. The special senses all start in general sensation, and sensation passes by them into perception through the growth of the intellectual element. The organs of sight and hearing, as first found in the animal kingdom, are fitted to give only the most vague sensations, and are probably unattended even by sensation in their earlier stages. The feelings are the earliest terms of conscious experience in the infant; these first indicate external facts and provoke inquiry concerning them. If knowing is not a kind of feeling, feeling is in itself a quasi knowing, and the constant language to the mind of those stable facts whose relations are to be made the subjects of thought. The feelings first evoke, and continue ever after to evoke, the thoughts and determine their direction. Volition is secondary both to feeling and thought. It is the springing up of the personality in its most direct energy to control its own life under the guidance offered by the intellect, and the impulses offered by the feelings. Thus, the prior condition and the ever present condition of voluntary action is that of the feelings. If we take a mechanical view of the mind, and construct a serial rather than a central dependence of its powers, we should place the feelings first as terms primarily given by the play of matter upon mind; the thoughts second, as called out in consciousness by the relation of the feelings to each other; and volition third, as incident to various feelings harmonized by judgment and carried forward by choice into one line of action. If we take a spiritual view of the mind, as holding within itself the secret of order and direction, and putting forth from itself in the accomplishment of a spiritual life each separate form of activity, we shall none the less see that its primary, constitutional states are emotional, and that the secondary ones are reflective and voluntary. While these are in one view instrumental under those, the currents merely in which the waters flow, they are, in another and deeper view, the energy with which a rational spirit at once begins to act on, and to control itself. Out of the heart are the issues of life, yet these fountains themselves can be reached and changed by the rational powers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Variables when viewed singly can be confusing and lead to inaccurate representation of the physiological status of the patient. Communication between the perfusionist and members of the surgical team requires accuracy and complete presentation of pertinent data. Toward this goal of improving the assimilation and processing of information during cardiopulmonary bypass, a multivariable computer-aided 'Heads-up Display' (HUD) was developed. Modern jet pilots use heads-up display for rapid assimilation of information when making judgments about the performance of their aircraft and weapons systems. Heads-up display is an electronically generated display that is superimposed upon a pilot's forward field of view. An analogy between a jet pilot and a perfusionist can be made. A geometric form, a hexagon, is used as part of the heads-up display for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB-HUD). The polygon represents a performance evaluation graph. Each of the six 'spokes of a wheel' represents a physiological parameter. The represented variables are: cardiac index, peripheral vascular resistance, hematocrit, dynamic operating blood level, venous saturation, and mean arterial pressure. The perfusionist inputs target values. Target values are then compared to actual values and expressed as a percentage. If all targeted values are achieved, the graphical representation is a hexagon. The surgical team rapidly recognizes abnormal patterns that are outside individual target values. They include, but are not limited to, patterns of: vasoconstriction, vasodilatation, hypovolemia, decreased oxygen carrying capacity, and several others. The CPB-HUD has proved to be of value for planning, real time evaluation, retrospective analysis of cardiopulmonary bypass benchmark data, and as an aid in the teaching of new personnel concerned with cardiopulmonary bypass.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0034104422", "issn": "00221058"}, "source": "Journal of Extra-Corporeal Technology", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jon W.", "last_name": "Austin"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/evaluation-headsup-display-cardiopulmonary-bypass", "year": 2000, "keywords": ["Cardiopulmonary bypass", "Computer", "Heads-up display", "Perfusion adequacy", "Perfusion monitoring"], "type": "conference_proceedings", "id": "0ed9cc80-5f71-328f-9cdd-e68fac0ada9e"}, {"title": "Impact of heads-up display imaging on endoscopic task performance.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Heads-Up Imaging goggles provide ergonomic advantages to the endourologist. This study was designed to evaluate whether heads-up display impacts task performance for ureteroscopic stone retrieval.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The ability to capture a 5-mm calculus with a Cook N-Circle 2.2F stone basket from an inanimate caliceal model was tested by three experienced and three novice stone-basket operators. Visual display for initial testing for each operator was randomized to the OptiVu HD3 Heads-Up googles or a 20- inch Sony Triniton monitor (TV). Subsequent testing alternated between the two devices. Camera input was provided by the Storz telecam SL-NTSC. The HD3 was set up to align the direction of view with the operator's hands, while the TV was aligned at an angle 45 degrees lateral and 30 degrees superior to the operator's direction of view to approximate the traditional room set-up for an endourologic procedure. Each operator performed five basketing trials with each display set-up.\\n\\nRESULTS: Expert operators retrieved calculi more rapidly (9.2 +/- 5.9 seconds) than novice operators (50.7 +/- 48.9 seconds), irrespective of whether a TV monitor or goggle display was utilized as the imaging modality.

The dynamic active display (DAD) is a unique prototype interface that presents safety-critical visual icons to the driver in a manner that minimizes the deviation of his or her gaze direction without adding to unnecessary visual clutter. As part of an automotive safety system, the DAD presents alerts in the field of view of the driver only if necessary, which is based upon the state and pose of the driver, vehicle, and environment. This paper examines the effectiveness of DAD through a comprehensive comparative experimental evaluation of a speed compliance driver assistance system, which is implemented on a vehicular test bed. Three different types of display protocols for assisting a driver to comply with speed limits are tested on actual roadways, and these are compared with a conventional dashboard display. Given the inclination, drivers who are given an overspeed warning alert reduced the time required to slow down to the speed limit by 38% (p < 0.01) as compared with the drivers not given the alert. Additionally, certain alerts decreased distraction levels by reducing the time spent looking away from the road by 63% (p < 0.01). Ultimately, these alerts demonstrate the utility and promise of the DAD system.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-61549100947", "pmid": "19068432", "issn": "10834419", "doi": "10.1109/TSMCB.2008.923527"}, "source": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics", "authors": [{"first_name": "Anup", "last_name": "Doshi"}, {"first_name": "Shinko Yuanhsien", "last_name": "Cheng"}, {"first_name": "Mohan Manubhai", "last_name": "Trivedi"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/novel-active-headsup-display-driver-assistance", "year": 2009, "keywords": ["Active safety", "Driver assistance systems", "Driver distraction", "Head movement tracking", "Human factors", "Integrated safety systems", "Intelligent driver-support systems"], "type": "journal", "id": "f178d479-83c9-359a-b070-f1264df76b9f"}, {"title": "Augmented reality: an application of heads-up display technology to manual manufacturing processes", "abstract": "The authors describe the design and prototyping steps they have taken toward the implementation of a heads-up, see-through, head-mounted display (HUDset).

Of particular interest is the relationship between Pteronotropis welaka and Pteronotropis hubbsi, both of which are nest associates with centrarchids, Although these species are morphologically similar, there is limited support for a sister-group relationship between them, We performed phylogenetic analyses of all five species currently recognized in Pteronotropis and five outgroup taxa based on nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene using both parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses, Pteronotropis hypselopterus and Pteronotropis euryzonus were consistently resolved as sister taxa, as were, P welaka: and P. hubbsi. Pteronotropis signipinnis was sister to the P. welaka plus P. hubbsi clade in likelihood and parsimony analyses when rate variation at third codon positions was taken into account. However, none of the analyses resolved a monophyletic group inclusive of all five species. If Pteronotropis is actually a monophyletic group, our inability to resolve it as such may be a result of sampling of outgroup taxa or the rate of evolution in cytochrome b in these taxa, Additional sampling of taxa, particularly within the genus Notropis is needed to further resolve phylogenetic relationships within Pteronotropis and the relationships of the species to other North American cyprinid taxa.

Changes are identified, notably the introduction into the latter two of traditional elements giving them increased religious content. Interpretations of the symbolism and meaing of the succession have hitherto been confined to an examination of the daij\u014d sai. Two approaches are identified. One is based on classical codifications and recorded instances of procedure. Here, the ritual centres on the partaking of food by the Emperor and the kami, thereby strengthening the spiritual power of the former. The other is based on myth and legendary history and interprets the daij\u014d sai as the occasion for the transfer of an imperial soul through the transformation and rebirth of the Emperor. The article proposes an interpretation which, by contrast, embraces all three contexts, namely, that the main theme is of the successively closer communication of the Emperor with the kami in each of these. Finally, the nature of the Emperor's elevation is considered, belng related on the one hand to more general notions of divinity among the Japanese, and on the other to similar contexts in Hindu kingship. The conclusion is that succession rituals involve a temporary and contextual divinity, which may then overflow into a more general elevation or sacredness, and that the Japanese case is an example of a situation also found in other monarchial successions.", "authors": [{"first_name": "Adrian C", "last_name": "Mayer"}], "source": "Japan Review", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/recent-succession-japan-ceremonies-emperor-japan", "year": 1991, "keywords": ["daij\u014d sai", "emperor", "senso", "soui rei", "succession"], "type": "journal", "id": "55fd483a-5f12-3ddd-9faf-69b8a465131e"}, {"title": "Project & Program Management for Enterprise Innovation ( P2M ) Promoted by the Project Management Association of Japan ( PMAJ )", "abstract": "The role of P2M guide in helping organizations reliasing strategic objective using Project Management and Program Management", "authors": [{"last_name": "Project Management Association of Japan"}], "source": "Project Management Association of Japan", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/project-program-management-enterprise-innovation-p2m-promoted-project-management-association-japan-p", "year": 2005, "keywords": ["P2M"], "type": "journal", "id": "a5a506b1-7a2c-3555-af7d-652c9a81ca19"}, {"title": "The Forces of Homology\u2014Hirohito, Emperor of Japan and the 1928 Rites of Succession", "abstract": "In November 1928, Hirohito became the emperor of Japan through a series of rituals, beginning with the emperor's presentation to the world.

All this was done with the aim of successfully competing with established world powers. Domestic and international affairs of Meiji Japan were appropriately described by the term naiyugaikan (worries at home and trouble with the outside) used during that unsettled period. Meiji thinkers and leaders were confronted with enormous difficulties in achieving their goals. From 1868 to 1905, catching up with the West was their most driving concern. The Western powers were extremely intimidating, and pre-industrial Japan, in so many aspects of its development, was so far behind. Inoue Kowashi (1843-95) was one of the most significant forces in the evolution and maturation of the Meiji restoration-the intellectual engineer for Ito Hirobumi (1841-1909) and many other prominent Meiji leaders whose positions afforded them the opportunity to wield actual power.

Struggles for equal rights have not been limited to the United States: during the Second World War, the Canadian military was acutely concerned with homosexuality and, as the war progressed, senior military brass became increasingly determined to rid the services of those engaged in \"disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind.\" Using a wide array of sources - including long-closed court martial records, psychiatric and personnel files, unit war diaries, films, and oral histories - Paul Jackson relates the struggle of queer servicemen of all ranks and branches of the Canadian military to fit in to avoid losing their careers and reputations.

However, development activities are not always compatible with the conservation of this diversity, and the ecosystem requirements of biodiversity are frequently not considered in the development planning process. One of the main reasons cited for inadequate representation of biodiversity is a lack of readily available information on the status and distribution of inland water taxa. In response to this need for information, the IUCN Species Programme, in collaboration with Zoo Outreach Organisation (ZOO) conducted the Eastern Himalaya Freshwater Biodiversity Assessment, a review of the global conservation status of 1,073 freshwater species belonging to three taxonomic groups fishes (520 taxa), molluscs (186 taxa), and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) (367 taxa). Other groups that include freshwater species that have been comprehensively (i.e. all known species) assessed are freshwater crabs (assessed in 2008, and 57 species of crab are present within the assessment region), mammals, birds, and amphibians and their assessments can be accessed on the IUCN Red List. In the process of study, which is based on the collation and analysis of existing information, experts were trained in biodiversity assessment methods, including the application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria and species mapping using GIS so\u017ftware. Distribution ranges have been mapped for the majority of species so providing an important tool for application to the conservation and development planning processes. Te full dataset, including all species distribution files (GIS shape files), is freely available in the CD accompanying this report and through the IUCN Red List of Treatened SpeciesTM iucnredlist.org). (www. Conservation measures are proposed to reduce the risk of future declines in species diversity and the associated ecosystem services that contribute to the livelihoods of millions of people across the region. Te geographic scope of this study is determined by the extended hydrological boundaries of the Eastern Himalaya region and includes all major river catchments with their origin within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot. Te major river systems of the Ayeyarwaddy (Irrawaddy), Kaladan (Kolodyne), Brahmaputra, and Ganga (Ganges) are included within this assessment. Freshwater species native to Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and parts of Myanmar, China (parts of the provinces of Xizang and Yunnan) and numerous states in northern and northeastern India are assessed. Species introduced to the region prior to 1500 AD are assessed, whilst species introduced a\u017fter that date are considered non-native to the region and are not assessed. IUCN Red List Criteria (IUCN 2001), the worlds most widely accepted system for measuring relative extinction risk, were employed to assess the status of all species. Information on each species was compiled by a small team, in collaboration with Specialist Groups of the IUCN Species Survival Commission and other relevant experts, who then conducted the assessment and its review. In total, more than 30 experts from the Eastern Himalaya region and elsewhere were involved in the process, either through direct involvement in the two review workshops or through correspondence.

Sixteen species, namely, Clubiona bakurovi, Clubiona corrugata, Clubiona hummeli, Clubiona komissarovi, Clubiona kulczynskii, Clubiona microsapporensis, Clubiona orientalis, Clubiona paralena, Clubiona propinqua, Clubiona proszynskii, Clubiona sapporensis, Mendoza nobilis, Pseudicius koreanus, Sibianor nigriculus, Sitticus penicilloides, and Yllenus coreanus, which have been described or reported to exist in North Korea were listed separately from the present list. From the zoogeographical distribution, Korean spider fauna was found to be influenced by northern species, including 35 Holarctic and 67 Palearctic species, which account for 14.9% of the total number of species. Korean endemic species include 131 species, which account for 19.2% of the total number. Among neighboring countries, Korean spiders are most similar to those found in Japan.

J. Simpson", "abstract": "The black man suffering at the hands of whites, the white woman sexually threatened by the black man. Both images have long been burned into the American conscience through popular entertainment, and today they exert a powerful and disturbing influence on Americans' understanding of race. So argues Linda Williams in this boldly inquisitive book, where she probes the bitterly divisive racial sentiments aroused by such recent events as O. J. Simpson's criminal trial. Williams, the author of Hard Core, explores how these images took root, beginning with melodramatic theater, where suffering characters acquire virtue through victimization. The racial sympathies and hostilities that surfaced during the trial of the police in the beating of Rodney King and in the O. J. Simpson murder trial are grounded in the melodramatic forms of Uncle Tom's Cabin and The Birth of a Nation. Williams finds that Stowe's beaten black man and Griffith's endangered white woman appear repeatedly throughout popular entertainment, promoting interracial understanding at one moment, interracial hate at another. The black and white racial melodrama has galvanized emotions and fueled the importance of new media forms, such as serious, \"integrated\" musicals of stage and film, including The Jazz Singer and Show Boat. It also helped create a major event out of the movie Gone With the Wind, while enabling television to assume new moral purpose with the broadcast of Roots. Williams demonstrates how such developments converged to make the televised race trial a form of national entertainment. When prosecutor Christopher Darden accused Simpson's defense team of \"playing the race card,\" which ultimately trumped his own team's gender card, he feared that the jury's sympathy for a targeted black man would be at the expense of the abused white wife. The jury's verdict, Williams concludes, was determined not so much by facts as by the cultural forces of racial melodrama long in the making. Revealing melodrama to be a key element in American culture, Williams argues that the race images it has promoted are deeply ingrained in our minds and that there can be no honest discussion about race until Americans recognize this predicament.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84947754299", "pmid": "1994843", "isbn": "0691058008"}, "source": "Melodramas of Black and White from Uncle Tom to O.

In particular, Sarah Meer shows how the theatrical mode of blackface minstrelsy, the slavery question, and America\u2019s emerging cultural identity affected how Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was read, discussed, dramatized, merchandised, and politicized here and abroad. Until Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, Meer says, little truly common ground existed on which the United States and Britain could debate slavery. In addition to cutting across class, gender, and national lines, the novel tapped into a huge, preexisting transatlantic appetite for blackface performance. Even as it condemned slavery, however, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was ambiguous about racial equality, and it portrayed blacks in demeaning ways. This gave copycat novels and minstrel stagings leeway to stray from Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s intentions. Minstrel-show versions in particular had a huge influence on later incarnations of the Uncle Tom story, converting the character into \u201ca comic, or worse, a proslavery stooge\u201d--a scorned figure in our popular memory. To look at how and why Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin \u201cboth advocated emancipation and licensed a plethora of racist imitators,\u201d Meer places it in the context of contemporary minstrel sketches, melodramas, songs, jokes, newspaper commentaries, slave narratives, travel writing, proslavery novels, and even Uncle Tom merchandise like china figurines and wallpaper.

During this period a resounding call to create a distinctively American music culture emerged as a way to bind together the varied, changing, and uncertain components of the new nation. This played out with particular intensity in the lower Mississippi River valley, and New Orleans especially. Ann Ostendorf argues that this region, often considered an exception to the nation-with its distance from the center of power, its non-British colonial past, and its varied population-actually shared characteristics of many other places eventually incorporated into the country, thus making it a useful case study for the creation of American culture. Ostendorf conjures the territory's phenomenally diverse \"music ways\" including grand operas and balls, performances by church choirs and militia bands, and itinerant violin instructors. Music was often associated with \"foreigners,\" in particular Germans, French, Irish, and Africans. For these outsiders, music helped preserve collective identity. But for critics concerned with developing a national culture, this multitude of influences presented a dilemma that led to an obsessive categorization of music with racial, ethnic, or national markers. Ultimately, the shared experience of categorizing difference and consuming this music became a unifying national phenomenon. Experiencing the unknown became a shared part of the American experience. \u00a9 2011 by The University of Georgia Press All rights reserved.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84898176865", "isbn": "082033975X"}, "source": "Sounds American: National Identity and the Music Cultures of the Lower Mississippi River Valley, 1800-1860", "authors": [{"first_name": "Ann", "last_name": "Ostendorf"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/sounds-american-national-identity-music-cultures-lower-mississippi-river-valley-18001860", "year": 2011, "type": "book", "id": "681aa7df-6a49-33b0-8d32-03f504ff8006"}, {"title": "Why choose the new I-35W Mississippi River Bridge?", "abstract": "On September 18th 2008, a replacement for the previously collapsed I-35W bridge opened to the public. Consequently, travelers were once again confronted with the opportunity to find better alternatives. The traffic pattern of the Minneapolis road network was likely to readjust, because of the new link addition. However, questions arise about the possible reasons (or components in the route choice process) that are likely to influence travelers crossing the Mississippi, who had to choose among the bridge options, including the new I-35W bridge. Using GPS data and web-based survey collected both before and after the replacement bridge opened, a bridge choice model is estimated using weighted-least squares logit. In this way the proportion of I-35W trips can be estimated depending on the assigned values of the explanatory variables, which include: statistical measures of the travel time distribution experienced by the subjects, alternative diversity, and others. The results showed that travel time savings and reliability were the main reasons for choosing the new I-35W bridge.", "authors": [{"first_name": "Carlos", "last_name": "Carrion-Madera"}, {"first_name": "David", "last_name": "Levinson"}], "source": "University of Minnesota: Nexus Research Group, Working Papers: 000082, 2010", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/choose-new-i35w-mississippi-river-bridge", "year": 2010, "keywords": ["I-35W Mississippi River Bridge, Route Choice, Rout", "Public Facility Location Analysis, Public Investme", "Transportation Economics: Government Pricing and P", "Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion, Sa"], "type": "journal", "id": "49b27e7d-8e55-37ab-be61-4f843b72127b"}, {"title": "Mississippi River discharge over the last ~560,000years - Indications from X-ray fluorescence core-scanning", "abstract": "The long term history of terrigenous flux to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River is hardly known.

The distribution of these gravels indicates that during the Pliocene, the Mississippi River flowed near its modern course. A longitudinal profile of a 50-m-thick Pliocene Mississippi River floodplain was constructed from northern Illinois to Memphis, Tennessee. This Pliocene profile was projected north through Grand Rapids, Minnesota, using the Holocene Mississippi River floodplain surface as a proxy for the base and top of the Pliocene floodplain.

Legacies of Slavery: Comparative Perspectives", "abstract": "The proclamation by the United Nations General Assembly of the International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition during 2004 marked the culmination of recent efforts to re-engage with slavery''s past and create an intellectual, social, political and ethical climate conducive to a sustained and meaningful dialogue among cultures and civilisations. The past decade witnessed an upsurge of national and international exhibitions and conferences on the impact of slavery and the overwhelming and enduring cultural miscegenation and the demographic, socio-political and spiritual hybridisation that the phenomenon consciously or unconsciously initiated; the celebration of efforts by Abolitionists to publicise the savagery of this inhumane practice; a revival of interest in and the glorification of, the often ignored or historically negatively represented resistance to slavery by slaves themselves; and, numerous endeavours to address the negative legacies of slavery like racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, which continue to impinge upon our present as part of contemporary politics.Yet, these ventures aimed at raising awareness of the horrors of slave trade and slavery, at honouring struggles for the emancipation of the enslaved, at examining the aftermath of slavery like the emergence of a new historic consciousness, at restoring broken links and solidarity between the historically dislocated diasporas and their countries of origin, at commemorating sites of memory, and, at celebrating artistic and cultural m\u010dtissage, such as the UNESCO''s Slave Route Project, have largely focused on the Atlantic World, and the deportation of slaves from Africa to other parts of the World, raising questions about the legacy of slavery in other societies, like those in Asia, the Pacific and Europe, where slavery still remains on the margins of national and post-colonial histories.This edited volume is an attempt to reconsider slavery as a global human institution which has coexisted with other socio-political, economic, legal and cultural institutions. As a temporally and spatially ubiquitous phenomenon, it has generated and continues to, engender legacies, be they historical, oral or visual, which need to be compared and discussed to facilitate dialogue between cultures and civilisations and to mitigate the wounds of the past which continue to scar our present. It brings together writings by scholars from history, literature, anthropology and cultural studies who examine the indelible mark left by slavery in its various forms, on societies, cultures and peoples all over the world and attempts by artistes and writers to alleviate this stigmata of History.This volume consists of two sections. The first section entitled Connecting Histories explores some of the varied forms in which slavery presented itself in the last four centuries and the need to reengage with its legacies. Adhering to Manning''s contention that slavery is an enduring metaphor for inequities in the treatment of humans, this section focuses on identifying the legacy of slavery and its significance in scholarship (Manning); alternate perspectives on slavery through the examination of forced labour and the dehumanising treatment of indigenous people in Australia (Read), enforced migration and labour exploitation of convicts in penal colonies (Maxwell-Stewart); and, a historical overview of Lusitanian slavery in India (D''Souza) and the hybridisation of pre-colonial slavery traditions in the perpetuation of the perkerniersstelse, or a profitably managed European settler-colony based on the global monopoly of nutmeg production, by the Dutch (Winn).The second section of the book entitled Centering Discourses: Identity, Image and Text begins with a postcolonialist reading of Caribbean slavery as a legacy of capitalism, imperialism and plantation culture and above all, the globalization of sugar consumption (Ashcroft).

Three centuries later these same intercontinental actions produced a movement that successfully challenged the institution at the peak of its dynamism. Within another century a new surge of European expansion constructed Old World empires under the banner of antislavery. However, twentieth-century Europe itself was inundated by a new system of slavery, larger and more deadly than its earlier system of New World slavery.

In Roman archaeology, where the framework provided by historical texts has always prevailed over theory, the absence of written documentation makes the task of seeing slaves in the archaeological record particularly challenging. Furthermore, the value of material culture is defined by both the quality of its preser- vation and the nature of the analysis that is brought to bear by scholars. Both factors have had critical consequences for the contribution material culture has made to the study of Roman slavery. At first glance, when com- pared to other aspects of Roman society and to the ubiquity and economic importance of slaves, Roman material culture offers relatively scant direct evidence.Much of this is due to the poor quality of housing, clothing and other goods used by slaves that reduces their chances of survival in the archaeological record and makes it impossible to reconstruct, for example, slave religion, diet, or other aspects of a slave subculture.", "identifiers": {"isbn": "978-0-521-84066-8"}, "source": "The Cambridge World History of Slavery", "authors": [{"first_name": "Michele", "last_name": "George"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/slavery-roman-material-culture", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["archaeology", "material cluture", "rome", "slavery"], "type": "book_section", "id": "3eb95b59-4342-3d01-bcdd-39c102151821"}, {"title": "Slavery and the Southwestern Evangelist in New Orleans (1800-1861)", "abstract": "Fundamentalism in New Orleans in the antebellum period produced mixed results.

Often these museums depict an idealized vision of the past that heavily emphasizes the experiences and possessions of the wealthy, white planter class while ignoring the large enslaved community that lived and worked on the plantation. Previous researchers have noted how little is said about slavery at these historic sites and have called for more inclusive, socially responsible narratives. This article suggests that, in general, these calls for inclusion have not been fully realized, finding that slavery is often misrepresented on tours at plantation museum sites in North Carolina, which have gone largely unexplored until now. In documenting marginalization of slavery at plantation sites, I conduct: (1) a content analysis of the frequency of hearing references to the enslaved in docent-led tours; and (2) a discourse analysis of the myths and representational strategies used by docents in framing public understanding of the history of slavery.

However, evidence suggests that one or both of these assumptions may be invalid in some rocks and at some scales. Both non-Fickian diffusion and heterogeneous matrix properties may lead to heavy-tailed (i.e., power-law) residence time distributions for tracers and radionuclides. Under some scenarios, such behaviour may lead to non-conservative estimates of radionuclide retention in Performance Assessment. Evidence for heterogeneous matrix properties includes geologic information about pore structure and matrix geometry, formation factor, and measurements of pore diffusivities. This variability may be compounded for sorbing solutes by heterogeneity in the distribution coefficient or kinetic rate coefficients. Evidence for non-Fickian diffusion is less well established, but includes depth-dependent pore diffusivities, fractal pore geometries in some rocks, and the likelihood that the matrix of some rocks may be very close to the percolation threshold at the pore-scale. Lab- and field-scale tracer tests have resulted in heavy-tailed breakthrough curves and have yielded estimates of characteristic retention times that scale with the duration of the experiment. These test results are consistent with the presence of either or both of heterogeneous matrix properties and/or non-Fickian diffusion. At the same time, there is evidence from electrical conductivity work and field diffusion studies that non-Fickian diffusion may be negligible at larger scales, so important questions remain. There is little doubt that at the smallest scales, matrix diffusion is affected by both heterogeneity and some form of non-Fickian behaviour. Consequences on radionuclide retention largely depend on the spatial and temporal extent of these. If the scales extend beyond those measured in the lab and field, then the consequences may include one or more of the following. (1) A single pore diffusivity and block size will not be able to represent the diffusion process at all time- or space-scales. Lab/field values may need to be different than PA-scale values. (2) The effective diffusion rate coefficient used decreases with time- and space-scales. (3) The retention capacity of host rocks may be smaller than apparent in lab and field tests because all of the pore space is not accessible via diffusion over the PA-scale transport time. (4) Certain experimental designs and/or parameter estimation techniques may be particularly susceptible to non-conservative parameter estimates, and should be avoided. Challenges to addressing heavy-tailed matrix residence times include lack of knowledge of pore geometry, pore connectivity, and matrix residence time distributions in many host rocks, difficulties with extremely long and expensive matrix diffusion experiments, and the ubiquitous issues of sparse data and uncertain parameters. Although models of heavy-tailed matrix residence times at the lab-scale (i.e., one-dimensional models with homogeneous parameters with respect to flow) are now available, incorporation of these effects into models that address flow and transport at the field scale has not been achieved.

My vision is to make it one of the world\u2019s most walking friendly cities by 2015. Walking is an enjoyable, free and accessible activity and for most people, a necessary part of their everyday journeys. Every journey begins and ends with an element of walking and every traveller is a pedestrian at various points during their trip. Wheelchair users are also pedestrians, although they may have additional design needs that determine their experience of the pedestrian environment. Walking contributes to the health and wellbeing of individuals and to many aspects of community life and the vibrancy of London. It is also a very popular leisure pursuit. The range of opportunities for leisure walking in London is vast, with an array of promoted, self guided routes and trails within the City and along rivers, canal paths, parks, woodlands, with attractive squares, landmarks and world class buildings to enjoy along the way. Walking is a fundamental part of human day-to-day activity, but walking environments can sometimes be challenging. It is important that we create a safe, attractive and accessible environment that enriches Londoners experience and appreciation of walking. This plan identifies all the key issues relevant to walking in London and proposes how they can be addressed in a practical and cost effective way. I challenge all those organisations involved in making London a walkable city to work together to deliver the actions contained within this plan'.", "authors": [{"last_name": "Transport for London"}], "source": "The Walking Plan for London", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/making-london-walkable-city-walking-plan-london", "year": 2004, "type": "report", "id": "896dfd59-21a3-35f5-90f7-bb1fca69d52f"}, {"title": "London Housing Design Guide", "abstract": "The new 'interim edition' of the London Housing Design Guide sets out the Mayor of London\u2019s aspirations for the design of new housing in the capital.

En el instituto las cosas no van mucho mejor: ha sido una paria desde el primer a\u00f1o y objeto de bullying debido a sus creencias religiosas y su ropa pasada de moda.

La madre de Carrie trata de forzarla a no ir, pero ella usa sus poderes para valerse por s\u00ed misma. Chris y su novio, Billy Noland, trazan un plan para humillar a Carrie frente a todo el instituto. Billy llena dos cubos con sangre de cerdo y los cuelgan encima del escenario, escondidos en una plataforma fuera de vista. La noche del baile, su madre atormenta a Carrie para que no vaya, pero ella va con Tommy de todas formas. Est\u00e1 nerviosa al principio, pero todo el mundo comienza a tratarla como a una m\u00e1s. Pronto comienza a disfrutar y Tommy empieza a sentirse atra\u00eddo por ella. Entre tanto, Sue se preocupa por lo que est\u00e1 pasando en el baile -y al mismo tiempo, por si est\u00e1 embarazada. Tommy y Carrie son elegido rey y reina del baile despu\u00e9s de una triqui\u00f1uela de Chris para falsificar los votos. Cuando est\u00e1n en el escenario, Chris les empapa con la sangre de cerdo mientras todo el mundo se\u00f1ala y se r\u00ede. Uno de los cubos cae en la cabeza de Tommy, hiri\u00e9ndole mortalmente. Carrie huye del escenario. Contemplando su vida en aislamiento, Carrie se acuerda de su poder y vuelve para vengarse de todos los que la han atormentado. Cierra las puertas y enciende el sistema de aspersores, pero tras ver a dos chicos morir por electrocucci\u00f3n, su mente revienta y decide incendiar el gimnasio y deja dentro a todos los que hab\u00edan ido al baile, incluido Tommy.

We hypothesised that compared to controls, gymnasts would have larger and stronger radius and tibia diaphyses with greater bone mineral content and larger cross-sectional muscle area. At the distal metaphyseal sites of the radius and tibia, gymnasts would have greater bone cross-sectional area and total and trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD). Differences between the lumbar spine, total body and body composition in gymnasts versus controls were also studied. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) was used to measure bone geometry, density and muscle of the peripheral skeleton; dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for total body and axial measurements. Eighty-six pre-pubertal children, 44 gymnasts (mean age 9.0 years, range 5.4-11.9 years) and 42 controls (mean age 8.8 years, range 5.6-11.9 years) were studied. Eighty-four children were Caucasian, one child was mixed race, one Chinese. Data were adjusted for age, sex and height. Differences in the effect size between sexes were also tested. At the 50% radius diaphysis gymnasts had larger bones (9.2%,p=0.0054) with greater cortical area (8.2%, p=0.022) and stress strain index (surrogate measure of bone strength) than controls (13.6%, p=0.015). The effect size was different between males and females for cortical thickness (p=0.03). At the 65% tibia diaphysis, gymnasts had greater cortical area (5.3%, p=0.057) and thickness (6.2%, p=0.068) than controls; consequently, bone strength was 5.4% higher (p=0.14). There were no significant differences in cortical volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at the radius or tibia diaphysis between the groups. There was a difference in effect size for tibia muscle cross-sectional area between the sexes (p=0.035). At the distal radius and tibia total and trabecular vBMD was greater (Total: radius 17%, p<0.0001, tibia: 5.7%, p=0.0053; trabecular: radius 21%, p<0.0001, tibia 4.5%, p=0.11). Bone size was not different in gymnasts compared to controls Lumbar spine BMC (12.3%, p=0.0007), areal bone mineral density (aBMD) (9.1%, p=0.0006) and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) (7.6%, p=0.0047) were greater in gymnasts but vertebral size was not significantly different. Likewise, total body BMD (3.5%, p=0.0057) and BMC (4.78%, p=0.085) were greater in gymnasts but there were no differences in skeletal size. These data suggest site-specific differences in how the pre-pubertal skeleton develops in response to the repetitive loading it experiences when participating in regular gymnastics. At diaphyseal sites these differences are predominantly in the bone and muscle geometry and not density. Conversely, at trabecular sites, the differences are increased density rather than geometry. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated skeletal differences between gymnasts and controls. These differences appear to be site and sex specific. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Osteoclast inhibition with denosumab decreased bone resorption, increased bone mineral density (BMD), and reduced fracture risk in osteoporotic women. The effects of 16months of continuous osteoclast inhibition on bone strength parameters were examined in adult ovariectomized (OVX) cynomolgus monkeys (cynos). One month after surgery, OVX cynos (n=14-20/group) were treated monthly with subcutaneous vehicle (OVX-Veh) or denosumab (25 or 50mg/kg). Sham-operated controls were treated with vehicle (n=17). OVX-Veh exhibited early and persistent increases in the resorption marker CTx, followed by similar increases in the formation marker BSAP, consistent with increased bone remodeling. Denosumab reduced CTx and BSAP throughout the study to levels significantly lower than in OVX-Veh or Sham-Veh, consistent with reduced remodeling. Increased remodeling in OVX-Veh led to absolute declines in areal BMD of 4.3-7.4% at the lumbar spine, total hip, femur neck, and distal radius (all p<0.05 vs baseline). Denosumab significantly increased aBMD at each site to levels exceeding baseline or OVX-Veh controls, and denosumab significantly increased cortical vBMC of the central radius and tibia by 7% and 14% (respectively) relative to OVX-Veh. Destructive biomechanical testing revealed that both doses of denosumab were associated with significantly greater peak load for femur neck (+19-34%), L3-L4 vertebral bodies (+54-55%), and L5-L6 cancellous cores (+69-82%) compared with OVX-Veh. Direct assessment of bone tissue material properties at cortical sites revealed no significant changes with denosumab. For all sites analyzed biomechanically, bone mass (BMC) and strength (load) exhibited strong linear correlations (r \n                        2=0.59-0.85 for all groups combined). Denosumab did not alter slopes of load-BMC regressions at any site, and denosumab groups exhibited similar or greater load values at given BMC values compared with OVX-Veh or Sham. In summary, denosumab markedly reduced biochemical markers of bone remodeling and increased cortical and trabecular bone mass in adult OVX cynos. Denosumab improved structural bone strength parameters at all sites analyzed, and strength remained highly correlated with bone mass. There was no evidence for reduced material strength properties of cortical bone with denosumab over this time period, which approximates to 4years of remodeling in the slower-remodeling adult human skeleton. These data indicate that denosumab increased bone strength by increasing bone mass and preserving bone quality. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79958772773", "pmid": "21497676", "issn": "87563282", "isbn": "1873-2763 (Electronic)\\r1873-2763 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2011.04.001"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "Michael S.", "last_name": "Ominsky"}, {"first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Stouch"}, {"first_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "Schroeder"}, {"first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Pyrah"}, {"first_name": "Marina", "last_name": "Stolina"}, {"first_name": "Susan Y.", "last_name": "Smith"}, {"first_name": "Paul J.", "last_name": "Kostenuik"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/denosumab-fully-human-rankl-antibody-reduced-bone-turnover-markers-increased-trabecular-cortical-bon", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["Bone quality", "Bone strength", "Cortical bone", "Denosumab", "Osteoporosis"], "type": "journal", "id": "1f5a0aa8-742f-3a61-811e-5c0c8c729b8a"}, {"title": "How B cells influence bone biology in health and disease", "abstract": "It is now well established that important regulatory interactions occur between the cells in the hematopoietic, immune and skeletal systems (osteoimmunology).

For samples of human vertebral cancellous bone in compression and for bovine cortical bone in tension, the coefficient of determination (r2) for regression between ultimate strength and stiffness was 0.89 and 0.92, and between yield strength and stiffness it was 0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The slope of the regression for human vertebral cancellous bone ultimate strength predicted by stiffness was not statistically different from similar regressions for cortical bone in tension in either a bovine sample or in published data from multiple species. We believe that the observed correlation results from the evolutionary need to build sufficiently strong bones using cells that are sensitive to deformation and that directly control bone stiffness, but not strength.

The bone phenotype of members of a HBM family is characterized by normally shaped bones that are exceptionally dense, particularly at load bearing sites [Cancer Res. 59 (1999) 1572]. The high bone mass (HBM) mutation was identified as a glycine to valine substitution at amino acid residue 171 in the gene coding for low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) [Bone Miner. Res. 16(4) (2001) 758]. Thus, efforts have focused on the examination of the role of LRP5 and the G171V mutation in bone mechanotransduction responses [J. Bone Miner. Res 18 (2002) 960]. Transgenic mice expressing the human G171V mutation have been shown to have skeletal phenotypes remarkably similar to those seen in affected individuals. In this study, we have identified differences in biomechanical (structural and apparent material) properties, bone mass/ash, and bone stiffness of cortical and cancellous bone driven by the G171V mutation in LRP5. As in humans, the LRP5 G171V plays an important role in regulating bone structural phenotypes in mice. These bone phenotypes include greater structural and apparent material properties in HBM HET as compared to non-transgenic littermates (NTG) mice. Body size and weight in HBM HET were similar to that in NTG control mice. However, the LRP5 G171V mutation in HET mice results in a skeleton that has greater structural (femoral shaft, femoral neck, tibiae, vertebral body) and apparent material (vertebral body) strength, percent bone ash weight (ulnae), and tibial stiffness. Despite similar body weight to NTG mice, the denser and stiffer bones in G171V mice may represent greater bone formation sensitivity to normal mechanical stimuli resulting in an overadaptation of skeleton to weight-related forces. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Several cytokine products of breast cancers (e.g. PTHrP, IL-11, IL-8) have been shown to act upon host cells of the bone microenvironment to promote osteoclast formation, allowing for excessive bone resorption. The increased release of matrix-derived growth factors, especially TGF-??, acts back upon the tumor to facilitate further tumor expansion and enhance cytokine production, and also upon osteoblasts to suppress bone formation. This provides a self-perpetuating cycle of bone loss and tumor growth within the skeleton. Other contributing factors favoring tumor metastasis and colonization in bone include the unique structure and stiffness of skeletal tissue, along with the diverse cellular composition of the marrow environment (e.g. bone cells, stromal fibroblasts, immune cells), any of which can contribute to the phenotypic changes that can take place in metastatic deposits that favor their survival. Additionally, it is also apparent that breast cancer cells begin to express different bone specific proteins as well as proteins important for normal breast development and lactation that allow them to grow in bone and stimulate bone destruction. Taken together, these continually emerging areas of study suggest new potential pathways important in the pathogenesis of bone metastasis and potential areas for targeting therapeutics. ?? 2010.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-78650304106", "pmid": "20643235", "issn": "87563282", "isbn": "1873-2763 (Electronic) 1873-2763 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2010.07.015"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "Julie A.", "last_name": "Sterling"}, {"first_name": "James R.", "last_name": "Edwards"}, {"first_name": "T.

We examine osteocytes in bone from four extant turtle species to form a morphological 'baseline', and then compare these with morphologies of osteocytes preserved in Cenozoic and Mesozoic fossils. Two different morphotypes of osteocytes are recognized: flattened-oblate osteocytes (FO osteocytes), which are particularly abundant in the internal cortex and lamellae of secondary osteons in cancellous bone, and stellate osteocytes (SO osteocytes), principally present in the interstitial lamellae between secondary osteons and external cortex. We show that the morphology of osteocytes in each of the three bone layers is conserved through ontogeny. We also demonstrate that these morphological variations are phylogenetically independent, as well as independent of the bone origin (intramembranous or endochondral). Preservation of microstructures consistent with osteocytes in the morphology in Cenozoic and Mesozoic fossil turtle bones appears to be common, and occurs in diverse diagenetic environments including marine, freshwater, and terrestrial deposits. These data have potential to illuminate aspects of turtle biology and evolution previously unapproachable, such as estimates of genome size of extinct species, differences in metabolic rates among different bones from a single individual, and potential function of osteocytes as capsules for preservation of ancient biomolecules. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84864770793", "pmid": "22584008", "issn": "87563282", "isbn": "8756-3282", "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2012.05.002"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "Edwin A.", "last_name": "Cadena"}, {"first_name": "Mary H.", "last_name": "Schweitzer"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/variation-osteocytes-morphology-vs-bone-type-turtle-shell-exceptional-preservation-jurassic-present", "year": 2012, "keywords": ["Cenozoic", "Exceptional preservation", "Mesozoic", "Osteocyte morphology", "Testudines"], "type": "generic", "id": "2456f336-cd3f-3d25-a065-2a87ad2af4d8"}, {"title": "Genetic variations that regulate bone morphology in the male mouse skeleton do not define its susceptibility to mechanical unloading", "abstract": "Genetics can substantially influence bone morphology and may define the skeleton's response to mechanical unloading. Recent data indicated that disuse produces different site-specific responses in the skeleton of genetically distinct adult female C3H/HeJ (C3H) and BALB/cByJ (BALB) mice; while disuse BALB mice had significantly less bone than age-matched controls in the distal and diaphyseal femur, the removal of weight bearing had a much smaller influence in C3H. Using adult male mice from these two inbred strains, the hypothesis was tested that interactions between genetic variations and anatomic location define bone morphology and its susceptibility to unloading. Four-month-old male BALB and C3H mice were either subjected to 21 days of hindlimb unloading or served as controls. Multiple cortical and trabecular regions within the distal and diaphyseal femur were analyzed by micro-computed tomography. C3H controls had significantly greater diaphyseal and metaphyseal cortical bone area (45% and 32%) and greater metaphyseal trabecular bone volume fraction (67%) than BALB controls, but epiphyseal trabecular bone volume fraction was similar between the two strains. Despite these substantial, site-specific differences in bone morphology, disuse induced similar changes in bone morphology in these two strains. Compared to controls, disuse BALB and C3H had significantly less metaphyseal (17% and 19%) and epiphyseal (10% and 13%) trabecular bone, while diaphyseal and metaphyseal cortical bone geometry was unaffected. These data indicate that the genetic variations that caused spatially nonuniform differences in trabecular and cortical bone morphology between the two strains had little influence on the susceptibility of a specific site to unloading. Cross-gender comparisons with previous data from female BALB and C3H mice further suggest strong interactions by which gender, genotype, and anatomical location define the response of the skeleton to the removal of weight bearing. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate this, we have attempted to further characterise the suppression of bone formation by the potent bone resorption inhibitor 3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidine-1-bisphosphonate (AHPrBP) in ovariectomised adult female rats. To see whether AHPrBP affects the activity of preexisting bone forming surfaces, as opposed to preventing the induction of new forming surfaces, three consecutive fluorochrome labels were administered 3, 10, and 17 days prior to sacrifice. The percentage of trabecular surface covered by first and second labels only (arrested surface), second and third labels only (induction surface), and all three labels (persisting surface) were recorded at the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibial metaphysis. As expected, ovariectomy increased the proportion of induction surfaces, with AHPrBP preventing this increase. However, AHPrBP also reduced the proportion of persisting surfaces, implying inhibition of the activity of preexisting boneforming surfaces.

Whether these factors influence bone's mechanosensitivity directly or indirectly through differences in phenotypic baseline bone morphology and cellular activity is unknown. Here, we examined whether indices of baseline bone morphology and cellular activity are associated with the gender- and site-specific susceptibility of bone to unloading. Adult mice (4??months old, BALB/cByJ ?? C3H/HeJ) were assigned to one of six groups: male and female baseline controls (n = 20 each), age-matched controls (n = 10 each), or disuse (n = 11 males, n = 12 females). All baseline controls were sacrificed (0??day) to establish baseline bone morphology with micro-computed tomography (n = 10 each gender) or baseline cellular activities using histomorphometry and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining (n = 10 each gender). Age-matched control and disuse mice were sacrificed (21??days) to determine disuse-induced bone loss by micro-computed tomography. Following 21??days of unloading, trabecular bone loss in the distal femur and proximal tibia was, on average, 3-fold greater in the metaphyses than in the epiphyses and 2-fold greater in females than in males. Disuse-induced changes in cortical bone were 2-fold smaller than trabecular bone losses and were more apparent in females (5 of 6 regions) than in males (1 of 6 regions). Bone loss was inversely related to baseline bone volume fraction (R2 = 0.51 for females and 0.43 for males) and directly related to baseline bone surface to volume ratio (R2 = 0.69 for females and 0.60 for males). Additionally, trabecular bone loss was correlated with baseline mineral apposition rates and osteoclast surface to bone surface ratios (R2 = 0.86 and 0.46, respectively, genders combined). These data demonstrate that baseline bone morphology and cellular activity modulate bone loss and that, independent of gender, anatomical regions with low bone quantity, high surface-to-volume ratios, and high levels of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity are particularly susceptible to disuse. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Blood samples were collected from goats and sheep monthly during pregnancy and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks postpartum (pp) and monthly during lactation until 6 months after parturition. Total bone mineral content (BMC) and total bone mineral density (BMD) were quantified using peripheral quantitative computed tomography at the same intervals as the blood was taken. Bone resorption was assessed by immunoassays quantitating two epitopes of the carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP, CTX). Bone formation was estimated by quantifying serum osteocalcin (OC) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bAP). In addition, Ca and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25-VITD) concentrations were determined in serum. Mean ICTP and CTX concentrations of both animal species increased the first week after parturition. By the second week pp, the concentrations of both markers had decreased toward early gestation levels. In contrast, mean OC concentrations continually decreased until the 1st week pp. By the 2nd week pp, the mean concentrations of OC started to increase again. Mean bAP activities decreased during gestation and reached a nadir in the first week pp in goats and 4 weeks pp in sheep. Afterwards, mean bAP activities increased again in goats and sheep. 1,25-VITD concentrations peaked the first week pp and returned to early gestation values thereafter. Total BMC and BMD decreased from the 4th month of pregnancy until the 1st week pp in both species. Afterwards, BMC increased throughout the first month pp in goats and the first 3 months pp in sheep. BMD levels of sheep and goats returned to prepartum levels during lactation. The resorptive phase of bone remodeling is accelerated at parturition and in early lactation and is uncoupled from the process of bone formation. This allows the animal to achieve Ca homeostasis at the expense of bone. Increased bone remodeling during lactation may represent physiological mechanisms to help replace the maternal skeleton lost as the animal adapted to enormously increased Ca losses to the fetus and milk in late gestation and early lactation. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Eleven patients with type I from three kindreds, and seven patients with type II, one family participated in the study, and were compared with 18 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Whole-body BMC and BMD were measured, and regions of special interest were selected: head, axial, and appendicular skeleton. Moreover, lumbar spine and femoral neck scans were performed. Whole-body BMC and BMD, mostly reflecting cortical bone, were markedly increased in both types compared with normals. A pronounced osteosclerosis was present in the axial as well as the appendicular skeleton. Median BMD was markedly increased in the axial skeleton by 51% (44-56) and 42% (33-56), (median differences with 95% CI), respectively, for types I and II compared to normal controls, and in the appendicular skeleton by 48% (37-59) and 38% (16-45). No overlap between observed ranges of patients and controls was observed. A positive correlation between age and whole-body BMD was demonstrated in ADO, but not in the control group, indicating progressive osteosclerosis with age. Median BMD of the lumbar spine, which mostly reflects trabecular bone, showed increased densities in both types, 71% (51-84) and 59% (37-93), respectively. The findings substantiate the clinical and radiographic impression of the disease with progressive osteosclerosis, and more pronounced symptoms in the elderly patients.

Granulocytes and/or granu- locyte precursors normally comprise approx 60% of the nucleated cells in bone marrow and the bloodstream. Mature neutrophils have a typical circulating half- life of 6\u20138 h in the blood and then migrate through tissues for approx 2-3 d. Their relatively short life-span is devoted largely to surveillance for invading microorganisms. During infection, the neutrophil life-span is extended, granu- lopoiesis increases, and large numbers of neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the site(s) of infection. Following recognition (binding) and phagocytosis of microorganisms, neutrophils utilize an extraordinary array of oxygen-depen- dent and oxygen-independent microbicidal weapons to destroy infectious agents. Oxygen-dependent mechanisms involve the production of reactive oxy- gen species (ROS), while oxygen-independent mechanisms include degranula- tion and release of lytic enzymes and bactericidal peptides. Inasmuch as these processes are highly effective at killing most ingested microbes, neutrophils serve as the primary cellular defense against infection. The aim of Neutrophil Methods and Protocols is to provide (1) a set of pro- tocols to assess most basic neutrophil functions, (2) protocols for investigating specialized areas in neutrophil research, and (3) step-by-step diagnostic assays of common neutrophil disorders. A wide variety of methods have been devel- oped to assess neutrophil function, and these methods have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the role of neutrophils in host defense and inflammatory disease. For those researchers and clinicians interested in the study of neutrophils, the availability of a comprehensive source of protocols describing the most modern methodological advances in neutrophil biology is invaluable, as many publications do not provide information on the finer details critical to success of a given method. As such, we have compiled a series of protocols written by leading researchers in the field that provide detailed guide- lines for establishing and performing the most common neutrophil function assays. Hints of the best way to perform these methods, as well as guidance in detecting associated problems are included so novice investigators will also be able to effectively utilize these assays. While the volume provides current pro- tocols for evaluation of most basic neutrophil functions and certain specialized functions, a section is dedicated to diagnostic assays for common neutrophil disorders. Thus, this volume is designed for the basic researcher involved in the vii viii Preface study of neutrophil function and clinical investigators interested in medical aspects of neutrophil function in health and disease. Part I is an overview of neutrophils and their role in host defense and inflam- mation. Part II describes the most commonly used methods to isolate neutro- phils from humans and other animal species and procedures for subcellular fractionation of human neutrophils. Part III encompasses protocols addressing neutrophil biochemistry, electrophysiology, signal transduction, and apopto- sis. Part IV details methods for investigating adhesion and chemotaxis, and is followed by protocols to assess phagocytosis and bactericidal activity (Part V). Part VI provides an extensive set of assays for evaluating NADPH oxidase assembly and activation, production of reactive oxygen species, and methods for purification of flavocytochrome b. Part VII includes protocols to measure gene expression in neutrophils, and Part VIII provides assays for diagnosis of the most common neutrophil disorders. In addition to the step-by-step proto- cols, the Notes section of each chapter provides an outstanding repository of useful and interesting information not typically published in the Methods sec- tions of standard journal articles.

LINQ will premier in Visual Studio 2008, and will become the next musthave skill for .NET developers. For more information about LINQ, you can check out the authorrs\"s portal at www.linqdev.com .Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 is all about code.Literally, this book starts with code and ends with code. In most books, the author shows the simplest example demonstrating how to use a method, but they so rarely show how to use the more complex prototypes. Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 is different. Demonstrating the overwhelming majority of LINQ operators and protoypes, it is a veritable treasury of LINQ examples.Rather than obscure the relevant LINQ principles in code examples by focusing on a demonstration application you have no interest in writing, Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 cuts right to the chase of each LINQ operator, method, or class. However, where complexity is necessary to truly demonstrate an issue, the examples are right there in the thick of it. For example, code samples demonstrating how to handle concurrency conflicts actually create concurrency conflicts so you can step through the code and see them unfold.Most books tell you about the simple stuff, while few books warn you of the pitfalls. Where Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 returns your investment is in the hours, and sometimes days, spent by the author determining why something may not work as expected. Sometimes this results in an innocent looking paragraph that may take you a minute to read and understand, but took days to research and explain.Face it, most technical books while informative, are dull. LINQ need not be dull. Written with a sense of humor, Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 will attempt to entertain you on your journey through the wonderland of LINQ and C 2008. What yours\"ll learn How to leverage all the new LINQ relevant C 2008 language features including extension methods, lambda expressions, anonymous data types, and partial methods. How to use LINQ to Objects to query inmemory data collections such as arrays, ArrayLists, and Lists to retrieve the data you want. Why some queries are deferred, how a deferred query can bite you, and how you can make deferred queries work for you. How to use LINQ to XML to revolutionize your creation, manipulation, and searching of XML data. How to query DataSets with LINQ to DataSet so you can coexist with legacy code and use LINQ to query databases other than SQL Server. How to query Databases with LINQ to SQL, write your own entity classes, and understand how to handle concurrency conflicts.

For much of the 20th century, the burning questions in IE linguistics lay in the area of phonology, as scholars struggled to determine the number and character of the laryngeal consonants assignable to the protolanguage.

A significant negative correlation was found for yield and percentage damage by codling moth but not for plum curculio damage. However, the estimated amount of fruit damaged by codling moth remained relatively stable over the period, indicating that changes in percentage damage depended on yield dynamics rather than changes in codling moth abundance. In contrast, the amount of fruit damaged by plum curculio showed biennial fluctuations and a positive correlation with yield, indicating that the population of this pest was capable of responding with increased oviposition in years with greater fruit yield.

Two new sections, on light relations and on growth regulators, form valuable additions, but the sections on propagation and geographical influences that were in the 2nd edition have been omitted to keep the book within the prescribed limits. It is particularly unfortunate that propagation is no longer included, as it is the beginning of all fruitgrowing and the section covered a field of great value to the student. Recent work on vegetative propagation, selection of seed parents, apomictic species as rootstocks, rootstock-scion effects and incompatibility are all worthy of inclusion. The majority of the other revisions consist of additional sentences here and there with occasional new paragraphs, being especially noticeable with the trace element deficiencies. The term \"recent\" is applied without change to work done from 1920 onwards- doubtless the results were recent when first mentioned in the book but surely the term might now be removed with advantage from all references prior to, say, 1945? The bulk of the tables date from the turn of the century, but one would imagine that in many cases more reliable figures have been obtained by modern research. The whole question of virus disease is too modern to appear and lithiasis of pears is attributed to drought or insects without mention that it is sometimes of virus origin. Black-end of pear in Oregon is ascribed to drought (1921 reference), and not brought up to date by later work, which has shown the trouble to be an effect of oriental pear rootstock. In the bibliographies at the end of each section the small number of post-war references is striking. The task of revising a work of this magnitude and of bringing it into line with the rapid advance of knowledge in the subject is formidable and probably beyond the power of any one man alone, but has not the time come when Professor Gardner might tackle a substantial re-writing of the book with the aid of a few of the many competent young American workers in Pomology?

As such, it follows the typology of a change from a modern to a postmodern military.

The present paper extends the theory of self-enforcing agreements in a long-term relationship (the Folk Theorem in repeated games) to the situation where agents change their partners over time. Cooperation is sustained because defection against one agent causes sanction by others, and the paper shows how such a \"social norm\" is sustained by self-interested agents u-der various degrees of observability. Two main results are presented. The first one is an example where a community can sustain cooperation even when each agent knows nothing more than his personal experience. The second shows a Folk Theorem that the community can realize any mutually beneficial outcomes when each agent carries a label such as reputation, membership, or licence, which are revised in a systematic way.", "identifiers": {"issn": "00346527", "doi": "10.2307/2297925"}, "source": "Folk", "authors": [{"first_name": "Social", "last_name": "Norms"}, {"first_name": "Community", "last_name": "Enforcement"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/social-norms-en-community-orcement", "year": 2010, "type": "journal", "id": "0fdc9aa3-d6f1-3fa2-9944-eb4e71e34004"}, {"title": "Social Studies of Science", "abstract": "Scientific and engineering research increasingly involves multidisciplinary collaboration, sometimes across multiple organizations.

At the implementation level, translation of policies into practice varies greatly across human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome services. FP service integration is more evident in VCT and PMTCT settings where counselling; provision of contraceptive methods other than condoms; and information, education, and communication (IEC) materials are available in varying degrees. Though staff at ART sites provide counselling and condoms, these condoms are promoted primarily to prevent HIV infection and re-infection as opposed to unintended pregnancy. In settings where family planning has been integrated into HIV/AIDS services, FP information and a limited range of nonsurgical contraceptive are made available to clients, and service providers have been trained in FP service delivery and referrals for specialized FP services. Most counsellors in each of the settings had received at least some kind of FP training in counselling and contraceptive methods. However, the formal referral systems and mechanisms are weak or non-existent and coordination remains problematic due to the vertical management of FP/reproductive health, VCT, and PMTCT programmes. Low use of contraceptives by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) may be attributable to several barriers, including actual and perceived side effects and the efficacy of some FP methods, a limited range of methods available in HIV/AIDS settings, male dominance over sexual decision making, and non-disclosure of serostatus to sexual partners. In addition, providers' attitudes toward use of non-condom methods of FP may discourage use of contraception among PLHAs who want to space or limit childbearing.

Alas, after the 2008 Olympics, the ticket buyers haven\u2019t come. Right now, the Bird\u2019s Nest serves as a winter amusement park known as the Happy Ice and Snow Season. In April, a promoter may stage a celebrity rock concert to \u201cestablish China as a world leader for global peace and a healthier planet.\u201d Or not. After that, the government says it may build a shopping center there.

In a week when the United States contemplates how long its future will be spent deep in debt, they also hint at how much its greatest creditor is pinning its own hopes of building wealth on dreams. Photo WINTER PLAY The Bird's Nest rang with cheers for soccer. Now it invites sledders. Credit ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images Two summers ago, China\u2019s Olympic extravaganza was recognized worldwide, and especially here, as a barely disguised metaphor for this nation\u2019s rise to worldwide importance. Eighteen months later, China is more important than its leaders could have imagined. But Beijing\u2019s famous Water Cube has hoofed its way from Olympic stadium to light-show concert hall to stage for a Russian performance of \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d Its latest incarnation is as an indoor water park. In the year after the Olympics, the iconic 91,000-seat Bird\u2019s Nest hosted a Jackie Chan concert, an Italian soccer match, an opera and a presentation of Chinese singing standards. But the local soccer team declined a deal to make it their home field, and the only tenants now are tourists who pay $7 to visit the souvenir shop. By most accounts, the vendors hawking trinkets outside the stadium outnumber the foreigners who go there to gawk. Outsiders may find this wasteful. After all, Atlanta\u2019s Olympic stadium became a baseball park, and Calgary\u2019s Saddledome a civic fixture. Then again, the Olympics seem to bring out profligacy in even buttoned-down governments. Consider Athens, where 21 of the 22 stadiums erected for the 2004 Olympics were reported last year to be unoccupied. The $14.4 billion cost of that party is being cited by some as a source of Greece\u2019s potentially destabilizing fiscal troubles. If China is different \u2014 and China is \u2014 it is because fiscal worries on the diminutive scale of Athens hardly register on Beijing\u2019s blotter. Overbuilding is not a prime concern. Indeed, some might call it an economic strategy. This is a nation of spanking new office towers and hotels and luxury apartment complexes, many built on spec, many financed with state-subsidized loans, or on state-subsidized property, or with low-cost steel from mills built with state subsidies. Many are more empty than full.

That\u2019s 12 points higher than the figure for San Bernardino, Calif., which the advisory firm REIS says was the worst major office market in America in the last quarter of 2009. Yet what seems awful in San Bernardino is the norm in effervescent Beijing. Real estate speculation here is rampant, many experts agree that housing and finance are riding bubbles, and everyone expects a big reckoning somewhere \u2014 a year? two? \u2014 down the line. But there was a reckoning after the Asia panic in 1999, and another reckoning in 2004, and both times the government bailed out the big state-owned banks, and the boom went on. Indeed, the government forgave the Agricultural Bank of China $120 billion in sour loans just last October without a peep of public protest. If you build it, the feeling is, they will come. Eventually, in a nation this large, someone will fill the convention center and the water park. And if not, well, build it anyway. Building creates jobs, and feeds prestige, and pumps up the GDP. Here in the nation that is too big to fail, as long as the bad loans don\u2019t overwhelm the good, the waste is tolerable. \u201cThat, to me, is the essence of the Chinese strategy,\u201d Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and a former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China division, said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cJust keep the machine going fast enough.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2010, on page WK3 of the New York edition with the headline: After the High Jumps, Empty Shells.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84896211448", "issn": "0362-4331"}, "source": "The New York Times", "authors": [{"first_name": "MICHAEL", "last_name": "WINES"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/after-summer-olympics-empty-shells-beijing", "year": 2010, "keywords": ["Beijing (China)", "Housing and Real Estate", "Olympic Games", "Olympic Games (2008)", "Stadiums and Arenas"], "type": "web_page", "id": "6662e2f6-b08f-30a7-b606-7772c92d6cef"}, {"title": "Mental health service demand during the Summer Olympics: Literature review", "abstract": "Aims and method: Estimates of the impact of the London 2012 Olympic Games on general health service demand have been made.

Although the impact of GDP is always positive, we show that the sign of the population effect depends on wealth and population size of a country. The results show that the spread of distance to frontier is very wide over time, across countries, gender, and sports: not only resource endowment matters but also utilization of resources. These differences can be seen as caused by differences in financial support, training methods, organization, or culture. Using a method proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995), the authors build on welldocumented results in the literature and identify the channels through which planned economies and host countries generate Olympic success.

This event marked an important psychological turning point for many Japanese, who saw it as marking their reemergence into the world community. National identity is often hidden in the daily assumptions and practices of members of the nation. Prestige events like the Olympics bring these to the surface and make them easier to analyze as the contents for performance and consumption of Self, for both Self and Other, are prepared. Furthermore, the specifics of Japanese national identity at this time made the Olympics a near perfect venue for this.                 I argue that an examination of this discourse reveals several tropes of Self shared across the mainstream of Japanese national identity in the mid 1960s. The first was that Japan had rebuilt from wartime destruction and was now a global scientific and technological leader. Second, the country had a mixture of Western modernity and Japanese tradition that made it uniquely suited to be an interlocutor between West and non-West. The government, urban spaces and public manners were modern, yet culturally, Japanese engaged in a self-Orientalizing discourse. Third, Japan was no longer the despised enemy from the Second World War, but was now a uniquely peaceful and internationalist country. The Olympics provided the stage upon which to perform this identity, but also a lens through which to study it.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79956236084", "issn": "04194209", "isbn": "9781109742923"}, "source": "ProQuest Dissertations and Theses", "authors": [{"first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Droubie"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/playing-nation-1964-tokyo-summer-olympics-japanese-identity", "year": 2009, "keywords": ["0332:History", "0700:Social structure", "History", "Japan", "National identity", "Nationalism", "Olympics", "Social sciences", "Social structure", "Sports", "Tokyo"], "type": "thesis", "id": "55902bf7-20a9-3cfc-8315-84e7a35b56ac"}, {"title": "LONDON STRIVES FOR ZERO WASTE SUMMER OLYMPICS 2012", "abstract": "When London made its bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, not only was \"sustainability\" front and center, equally paramount was leaving a legacy of public benefits to help justify the nearly $18 billion price tag.

Will this trend continue in the years ahead? The question is difficult to answer precisely, because the factors shaping international migration flows are tremendously complex and hard to predict, as are changes in the migration policies of receiving countries. Yet clearly decision makers in government, business and society at large would be better equipped to address the opportunities and risks if they had a better understanding of the developments likely to influence global migration over the longer term. This book explores the social, economic and environmental forces that may combine to attract migrants of various types and backgrounds to OECD countries, as well as those that may persuade migrants to leave their countries or to stay at home. By analysing different pull and push factors and constructing five different scenarios of migration in the future, this volume endeavours to cast light on a range of key questions. Which factors will be major determinants of global migration flows? Which OECD countries will look particularly attractive for migrants? Outside the OECD area, where will the pressures to migrate be especially strong? And what kind of migration-related issues will policy makers likely be facing as a result, as 2030 approaches?", "identifiers": {"doi": "10.1787/9789264064126-en", "isbn": "9789264044494"}, "source": "International Migration", "authors": [{"first_name": "Organisation For Economic Co-operation And", "last_name": "Development"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/future-international-migration-oecd-countries-5", "year": 2009, "type": "book", "id": "2089fc68-b305-3a67-bd33-4f4c1f9447e7"}, {"title": "OECD: Obestiy Update 2014", "abstract": "The majority of the population, and one in five children, are overweight or obese in the OECD area.

Obesity and overweight have been virtually stable, or have grown modestly, in Canada, England, Italy, Korea, Spain and the United States, but have increased by a further 2-3% in Australia, France, Mexico and Switzerland. The economic crisis is likely to have contributed to further growth in obesity. Social disparities in obesity persist, and have increased in some countries. A growing number of countries have adopted policies to prevent obesity from spreading further. Mexico, for instance, has launched one of the most comprehensive government strategies to address the problem in 2013, including awareness-raising, health care, regulatory and fiscal measures.

However, the most dynamic sector of the labor market requires more than mere translation. The demand is increasingly for professional competence in a range of new technologies. Translators now need professional competence in the use of programs for translation memories, terminology management, sometimes content management, and increasingly the integration of various forms of automatic or semi-automatic translation. At the same time, the use of these technologies is being associated, rightly or wrongly, with the development of what is known as the localization industry. Faced with these new technologies, and with the new terms, many of the institutions that traditionally train translators are asking how, and to what extent, the existing curricula need be changed. The papers brought together in this volume seek to address this question in various ways. All have been drawn from various activities organized by the Intercultural Studies Group in recent years. The first papers seek to give a general background to the recent developments in translation technology. The paper on Technology and Translation, by Jos\u00e9 Ramn Biau Gil and Anthony Pym, was first written as a chapter of a university-level coursebook in translation, to be published in Italy. Its aim is not only to introduce the range of new tools available, but to encourage critical thought about the use of electronic technologies. The second paper in this introductory section, Bert Esselinks The Evolution of Localization, was first published in 2003 and has been updated for this volume. It tells a similar story of technology, but this time from within the industry. Esselink traces the expansion of the localization industry from a narrow concern with software to a major way of thinking about the marketing of products across borders. Section two of this volume is drawn from the online conference on Localization and Translator Training, which took place on the ITIT list (Innovations in Translator Training) from 19 to 29 November 2003, with about 530 participants. The conference was based on number of position papers written by representatives of some of the main translator-training institutions. In most cases, those papers were responses to a brief questionnaire designed to explore the relations between the terms translation and localization with specific reference to training needs. The replies reproduced here are by Minako OHagan from Dublin City University in Ireland, Bob Clark, Jo Drugan, Tony Hartley and Daming Wu from the University of Leeds, UK, and Patrick Drouin from the University of Montreal. The online discussions that followed those papers can be seen on the ITIT list What we present here are summaries of some of the main topics, written up by students in the Tarragona PhD program in Translation and Intercultural Studies: Localization and Translator training, Is localization just technology?, Finding qualified trainers, and What is XML and how do we teach it?. In most cases those discussions produce answers, as well as interesting questions. The third section of this volume mainly comprises papers from the symposium Technology and Translation, which took place in Tarragona on 28 and 29 November 2003. The symposium was designed to complement the online conference, extending the issue of new technologies in several directions. Frank Austerm\u00fchls paper Training Translators to Localize explains in some detail the rationale behind the various types and levels of training that he used at the School of Applied Linguistics and Cultural Studies at Germersheim (University of Mainz) in Germany (Austerm\u00fchl has since moved to the University of Auckland in New Zealand). Hannu Jaatinen and Riitta J\u0646\u0646skel\u0646inen report on the project Computing for Language Careers, carried out at the Savonlinna School of Translation Studies in Finland. Jos\u00e9 Ramn Biau Gil reports on the teaching electronic tools for translators in a 100% online training environment, based on his experience in the online courses organized in Tarragona. Ignacio Garc\u064aa, from the University of Western Sydney in Australia, looks at the way translators assess translationmemory programs on one of the professions main discussion lists. Andr\u00e9s Salter Iglesias, of the Universidad de Vigo, Spain, considers the development of Internet telephony and the way it has helped change the translation profession.

The premise: Bridges are normally built on-time, on-budget, and do not fall down. On the other hand, software never comes in on-time or on-budget. In addition, it always breaks down. (Nevertheless, bridge building did not always have such a stellar record. Many bridge building projects overshot their estimates, time frames, and some even fell down.) One of the biggest reasons bridges come in on-time, on-budget and do not fall down is because of the extreme detail of design. The design is frozen and the contractor has little flexibility in changing the specifications. However, in today's fast moving business environment, a frozen design does not accommodate changes in the business practices. Therefore a more flexible model must be used. This could be and has been used as a rationale for development failure. But there is another difference between software failures and bridge failures, beside 3,000 years of experience. When a bridge falls down, it is investigated and a report is written on the cause of the failure. This is not so in the computer industry where failures are covered up, ignored, and/or rationalized. As a result, we keep making the same mistakes over and over again. Consequently the focus of this latest research project at The Standish Group has been to identify: The scope of software project failures The major factors that cause software projects to fail The key ingredients that can reduce project failures", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84947948065", "doi": "0674"}, "source": "Group", "authors": [{"last_name": "Standish Group"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/chaos-report", "year": 1995, "type": "web_page", "id": "849db757-93e6-3184-922d-cd2d7b63e9b4"}, {"title": "Project Europe 2030", "abstract": "We have the honour of submitting the report requested by the European Council, at its meeting in Brussels on 14 December 2007, on the challenges that are likely to face the EU in 2030 and how we might address them. This Report reflects the work of a diverse group of individuals with diverse priorities and interests. It is the outcome of lengthy debates and discussions, and as such it represents both consensus and compromise. Not all the proposals have every Member's support, but every Member supports the majority of its contents. The uncertainty which characterises our times has made the task entrusted to us particularly difficult. We were forced to base our analysis only on those long-term trends that are easier to discern. Our findings are reassuring neither to the Union nor to our citizens: a global economic crisis; States coming to the rescue of banks; ageing populations threatening the competitiveness of our economies and the sustainability of our social models; downward pressure on costs and wages; the challenges of climate change and increasing energy dependence; and the Eastward shift in the global distribution of production and savings. And on top of this, the threats of terrorism, organised crime and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction hang over us. Will the EU be able to maintain and increase its level of prosperity in this changing world? Will it be able to promote and defend Europes values and interests? Our answer is positive. The EU can be an agent of change in the world, a trend-setter, and not just a passive witness. But this will only be possible if we work together; the challenges ahead are too large for any European country to address on their own. Our ability to influence developments beyond our borders will in turn depend on our capacity to secure solid growth and internal cohesion within the Union. This is the conclusion reached by our Reflection Group, following intensive deliberations and consultations with numerous experts and institutions. All our members agree on one fundamental issue: Europe is currently at a turning point in its history. We will only overcome the challenges which lie ahead if all of us - politicians, citizens, employers and employees - are able to pull together with a new common purpose defined by the needs of the current age. Since our group was established, Europe has seen a number of important developments, including the institutional crisis caused by the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty, and the recent financial crisis which has triggered a global recession. The successful ratification of the Lisbon Treaty allowed us to end a long period of introspection which had distracted the Union from the major challenges affecting our future. Unfortunately, the financial crisis, which was the result of shortcomings in the functioning and supervision of our financial institutions, is still with us today. The situation within the Union, and therefore our own reflections, have been deeply affected by the social, economic and political ramifications of the crisis. At this crucial juncture, the EU needs to act decisively and together in avoiding protectionist temptations. FROM MEMBERS OF THE REFLECTION GROUP TO THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL 4 This crisis, whose origins lie on the other side of the Atlantic, has affected Europe more than any other region of the world by uncovering structural weaknesses in the European economy that have long been diagnosed but too often ignored. The crisis has therefore acted as a wake-up call for Europe to respond to the changing global order. As with all transformations, the emerging order will result in new winners and losers. If Europe does not want to be among the losers, it needs to look outwards and embark on an ambitious long-term reform programme for the next twenty years. EU leaders must continue adopting measures to overcome the current crisis but these must be connected to the medium and long-term reforms which the Union needs. We speak of the Union because of our Single Market, because of our common currency and our stability and growth pact which mean we are interdependent. Europeans must tackle the crisis together, or each see our respective initiatives fail. In order to exit fully from the crisis, we must continue the stimulus measures until our economies can function on their own. If spending is cut too early, our recovery could slip into reverse. Our top priority must remain creating jobs and growth. And those Member States that can no longer afford to spend, due to costly rescue operations, rising social expenditure and declining sources of revenue, will have to rely on the EU and other Member States to take the lead in setting up the conditions for economic recovery. Strengthening economic governance in the EU is urgently needed if we are to avoid the asymmetric shocks which derive from the co-existence of our monetary union and single market with divergent economic policies. The origins of the crisis had little to do with the Euro and Stability and Growth Pact, but these mechanisms have not been sufficient to ensure economic convergence during the crisis. The EU needs to find solutions to the existing imbalances between Member States, by examining and correcting the losses in competitiveness reflected in balance of payments and current account deficits. These issues need to be included in the Unions convergence criteria and an instrument for ensuring monetary stability is needed to confront unforeseen crises. If the EU is to avoid a repeat of the crisis, it must urgently undertake reforms to the functioning and supervision of our financial institutions. Today, these financial institutions have changed few of the practices which led to the crisis, except to significantly reduce their lending. It would be desirable for these reforms to be coordinated among the G20, but until this happens, the EU must develop its own regulatory norms and mechanisms for control and supervision. Our citizens will simply not tolerate another rescue operation on the scale we have witnessed. Looking to the 2030 horizon, Europeans will need a highly competitive and sustainable social market economy in order to maintain social cohesion and fight against climate change. This will require an ambitious reform programme with clear priorities and much more effective enforcement mechanisms than the Open Method of Coordination can provide. In this context, we assume that the Commissions new Europe2020 strategy will form part of this major endeavour. The EU must therefore implement without further delay the structural reforms that are still pending from the Lisbon Agenda. This will require reforming the new strategys implementation mechanisms, by means of a more effective system of incentives, to ensure that the objectives decided by the European Council and other European institutions are actually met. 5 Human capital is the key strategic instrument for ensuring success in the global economy. And yet, Europe has lost considerable ground in the race to a knowledge economy. Catching up will require a coordinated effort. Member States must mobilise the resources they agreed to invest in R&D, with the help of the private sector, and reform all aspects of education, including professional training. The Union must also act through its own revised budgetary instruments, while making better use of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund. Finally, we need to consider the possibility of opening up new sources of revenue, for instance through the imposition of a carbon tax. The EU needs to implement a common energy policy with both internal and external dimensions that will allow us to achieve greater energy efficiency and savings of the kind advocated in the Europe2020 strategy, and diversify our energy supplies from third countries. Europeans also need to embark on a serious discussion about the need for safe nuclear energy in Europe, and to define the contours of a permanent system of incentives for the development of alternative energy sources. The EU must continue leading the fight against climate change. Yet, in order to be more effective and relevant in the emerging world order it must avoid repeating the mistakes we made in Copenhagen. It will be necessary to develop a truly common negotiation strategy which would allow us to defend our interests better. Europeans must tackle our demographic challenge. If urgent measures are not taken, our ageing societies will put unsustainable pressure on our pension, health and welfare systems, and undermine our economic competitiveness. Priority measures must include increasing the proportion of women in the workforce; facilitating a better work-life balance; reforming our approach to retirement, so that it is seen as a right and not an obligation; and developing a more pro-active immigration policy suited to our demographic and labour market needs. The EU must strengthen the Single Market against temptations of economic nationalism and complete it to include services, the digital society and other sectors, which are likely to become the main drivers of growth and job creation in a market of 500 million users and consumers. The strengthening and completion of the Single Market should be accompanied by improved tax coordination. Europeans must reform the labour market and modernise our corporate governance practices. If we are to fully realise the potential of the technological revolution, we must make major changes to our labour market structures. Some Member States have already implemented successful reforms based on the model of flexicurity; we have to learn from these experiences while adapting them to our different national circumstances. We must increase the employability of our workers and the flexibility of our companies in an economy that is in constant flux. Improving labour productivity must become a priority, and productivity gains must be made directly proportionate to levels of inc", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79959300479", "isbn": "9789282427019"}, "source": "Group", "authors": [{"first_name": "European", "last_name": "Council"}, {"first_name": "Reflection", "last_name": "Group"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/project-europe-2030", "year": 2010, "type": "journal", "id": "b0d53648-9ef7-3951-88f5-83f642d2648f"}, {"title": "Wave hub development and design phase", "abstract": "Detailed description of the design of the wave hub project.

As these scanners can only record discrete data sets (point clouds), it is necessary to mesh these sets for getting closed 3D models and take advantage of 3D graphics acceleration of modern graphics hardware. The meshing process is a complex issue and in the last years there were lots of algorithms developed to solve this problem. In this work a continuous Level-of-Detail (LOD) algorithm will be presented, from which a simplified 3D surface model can be created, which uses only as much triangles as needed. The grade of simplification is user-defined by an error tolerance similar to the Hausdorff distance. This algorithm is not a dynamic (view-dependent) LOD mesh simplification, but a non-redundant approximation of point clouds. It is a simple and extendable meshing algorithm, which is made up of a mixture of some techniques adapted from popular terrain LOD algorithms. The algorithm has been implemented in an OpenGL based editing tool for 3D point clouds called PointMesh, which will be explained in detail. We present examples from an excavation site (church rest of Lorsch Abbey, Germany), the inner part of the Heidelberg Tun (German: Gro\u00dfes Fass, an extremely large wine vat) and the Old Bridge gate, Heidelberg.

The shape effect, size effect and aspect ratio (length to width ratio) effect of different samples were studied. These were all vital for the development of micromagnetic devices in the future. From the experiment, by micromagnetic modeling, it was found that four different mechanisms were seen in nine hexagon samples of different widths and aspect ratios and two mechanisms were observed in three triangle samples of aspect ratio 1. The reversal fields found by simulation are all larger than that by the Lorentz electron microscopy done by my research partner, which is due to the defects, present in the lithographically-defined elements used in microscopy.

Planned Parenthood of Central New Jersey brought an action to prohibit the enforcement of the Act. The New Jersey Supreme Court held that women, both minors and adults, have a fundamental right to decide whether to terminate their pregnancies. Although the state may impose restrictions on a minor's rights in an effort to protect the minor from her own immaturity, the Court found that the Act imposed restrictions on minors seeking abortions that it did not impose on minors seeking medical and surgical care relating to their pregnancies. The Act required parental notification for a minor seeking an abortion but did not require parental notification for a cesarean section, a considerably more difficult and complicated procedure.

Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers that increase in concentration as a function of cell density. The detection of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of an autoinducer leads to an alteration in gene expression. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing communication circuits to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities. These processes include symbiosis, virulence, competence, conjugation, antibiotic production, motility, sporulation, and biofilm formation. In general, Gram-negative bacteria use acylated homoserine lactones as autoinducers, and Gram-positive bacteria use processed oligo-peptides to communicate. Recent advances in the field indicate that cell-cell communication via autoinducers occurs both within and between bacterial species. Furthermore, there is mounting data suggesting that bacterial autoinducers elicit specific responses from host organisms. Although the nature of the chemical signals, the signal relay mechanisms, and the target genes controlled by bacterial quorum sensing systems differ, in every case the ability to communicate with one another allows bacteria to coordinate the gene expression, and therefore the behavior, of the entire community. Presumably, this process bestows upon bacteria some of the qualities of higher organisms. The evolution of quorum sensing systems in bacteria could, therefore, have been one of the early steps in the development of multicellularity.", "authors": [{"first_name": "New", "last_name": "Jersey"}], "source": "Annual Review of Microbiology", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/ensing-12", "year": 2001, "keywords": ["and", "autoinducer", "cell-cell", "communication", "density", "gene expression in response", "homoserine lactone", "is the regulation of", "quorum sensing bacteria produce", "s abstract quorum sensing", "to uctuations in cell-population", "two-component system", "virulence"], "type": "journal", "id": "021646b2-f90d-3b2b-98f6-e010ea260fcb"}, {"title": "Modelling association football scores", "abstract": "Previous authors have rejected the Poisson model for association football scores in favour of the Negative Binomial.

Social movements are central to democracy and democratization. This book examines the interaction between states and environmentalism, emblematic of contemporary social movements. The analysis covers the entire sweep of the modern environmental era that begins in the 1970s, emphasizing the comparative history of four countries: the US, UK, Germany, and Norway, each of which captures a particular kind of interest representation. Interest groups, parties, mass mobilizations, protest businesses, and oppositional public spheres vary in their weight and significance across the four countries. The book explains why the US was an environmental pioneer around 1970, why it was then eclipsed by Norway, why Germany now shows the way, and why the UK has been a laggard throughout. Ecological modernization and the growing salience of environmental risks mean that environmental conservation can now emerge as a basic priority of government, growing out of entrenched economic and legitimation imperatives. The end in view is a green state, on a par with earlier transformations that produced first the liberal capitalist state and then the welfare state. Any such transformation can be envisaged only to the extent environmentalism maintains its focus as a critical social movement that confronts as well as engages the state.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84921994659", "issn": "1462317X", "isbn": "9780191599095", "doi": "10.1093/0199249024.001.0001"}, "source": "Green States and Social Movements: Environmentalism in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Norway", "authors": [{"first_name": "John S.", "last_name": "Dryzek"}, {"first_name": "David", "last_name": "Downes"}, {"first_name": "Christian", "last_name": "Hunold"}, {"first_name": "David", "last_name": "Schlosberg"}, {"first_name": "Hans Kristian", "last_name": "Hernes"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/green-states-social-movements-environmentalism-united-states-united-kingdom-germany-norway", "year": 2003, "keywords": ["Democracy", "Ecological modernization", "Environmental risks", "Environmentalism", "Green state", "Interest representation", "Legitimation", "Public sphere", "Social movements", "States"], "type": "book", "id": "8aa96c4f-18bf-32a9-ac6c-0271974decf6"}, {"title": "Acculturation of Iranians in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands", "abstract": "The present study tested the generalizability of a multidimensional individual difference acculturation (MIDA) model in three cultural contexts.

In Canada and the United States, studies have also reported a number of systems that have had minimum pH levels below 4??5. In all areas, change in water flowpath during hydrological events is a major determinant of episode characteristics. Episodic acidification is also controlled by a combination of other natural and anthropogenic factors. Base cation decreases are an important contributor to episodes in circumneutral streams and lakes. Sulphate pulses are generally important contributors to episodic acidification in Europe and Canada. Nitrate pulses are generally more important to episodic acidification in the Northeast United States. Increases in organic acids contribute to episodes in some streams in all areas. The sea-salt effect is important in near-coastal streams and lakes. In Canada, Europe and the United States, acidic deposition has increased the severity (minimum pH reached) of episodes in some streams and lakes. ?? 1992.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0027040303", "pmid": "15091924", "issn": "02697491", "doi": "10.1016/0269-7491(92)90006-V"}, "source": "Environmental Pollution", "authors": [{"first_name": "P.

Knowledge of elbow kinematics and kinetics may be helpful in preventing injuries due to push-ups if the elbow shear force can be reduced. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different push-up speeds on elbow joint loading. Fourteen healthy male graduate students volunteered for this investigation. In a motion analysis laboratory, the Expert Vision motion system with eight 240 Hz cameras and 1000 Hz Kistler force plates were used to measure relative joint positions and ground reaction forces. The surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure the signals of muscle activity. Each subject performed push-ups in three different conditions that were pre-determined: fast speed (7 push-ups/10 s), regular speed (5 push-ups/10 s), and slow speed (4 push-ups/10 s). The kinematics and kinetics data were obtained from the Expert Vision motion system. The joint angles, resultant forces and moments of the elbow at different push-up speeds were calculated by laboratory-developed software. The peak elbow medial shear force and compression force in the fast group were 1.35 and 1.23 times greater than those in the slower group, respectively. In addition, the peak valgus moment, extension moment, and pronation moment at fast push-up speed were 1.63, 1.34 and 1.41 times greater than at slow speed, respectively. Additionally, performing the push-up more slowly could significantly increase the muscle activations in triceps brachii, biceps brachii, and posterior deltoid muscle groups, and thus be of greater benefit in muscle training. Therefore, performing the push-up exercise more slowly may be a better strategy for strengthening the upper extremity muscles.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79960652403", "issn": "16090985", "isbn": "1609-0985", "doi": "10.5405/jmbe.772"}, "source": "Journal of Medical and Biological Engineering", "authors": [{"first_name": "Paul Pei Hsi", "last_name": "Chou"}, {"first_name": "Hsiu Hao", "last_name": "Hsu"}, {"first_name": "Shen Kai", "last_name": "Chen"}, {"first_name": "Su Kuan", "last_name": "Yang"}, {"first_name": "Chia Ming", "last_name": "Kuo"}, {"first_name": "You Li", "last_name": "Chou"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/effect-pushup-speed-elbow-joint-loading", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["Biomechanics", "Elbow", "Motion analysis", "Push-up"], "type": "journal", "id": "c1cf2ddb-73aa-3d3f-aa6d-71388a564254"}, {"title": "The Push-up Behavior of Japalura Dragon", "abstract": "\u53f0\u7063\u6500\u6728\u8725\u8734(Japalura Dragon)\u96c4\u6027\u6709\uf9b4\u57df\u6027\uff0c\u500b\u9ad4\u9593\uff0c\u4ee5\u8996\u89ba\u6e9d\u901a (visual- communication)\u70ba\u4e3b\u3002\u96c4\u6027\u7684\u6c42\u5076\u548c\u6253\u9b25\u5c55\u793a\ufa08\u70ba(display behavior)\uff0c\u5305\u542b \u4f0f\u5730\u633a\u8eab(push-ups)\u3001\u9ede\u982d(head-nods)\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65bc 2007 \uf98e 4 \u6708\u81f3 7 \u6708\u9593\uff0c\u4ee5 DV \u651d\u5f71\uff0c\u7d00\uf93f\u53f0\u5357\u65b0\u5316\u5730\u5340\u6500\u6728\u8725\u8734\u7684\u5c55\u793a\ufa08\u70ba\u3002\u7e3d\u5171\u7d00\uf93f 22 \u96bb\u96c4\u6027\u6210\u9ad4\u7684\u5c55\u5f0f \ufa08\u70ba\u3002\u6574\u9ad4\u521d\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u5171\u6709 36 \u7d44\u5c55\u793a\ufa08\u70ba\u3002\u6bd4\u8f03\u5c0d\u7167\u9019\u4e9b\u5c55\u793a\ufa08\u70ba\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u4e00\u7a2e\u56fa \u5b9a\u7684\u5c55\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f (63.9%)\uff0c\u5167\u542b\u53e6\u7a2e\u4e9b\u5fae\u7684\u5dee\uf962\u6a21\u5f0f(22.2%)\u3002\u6bcf\u7d44\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c55\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6642 \u9593\u7d04\u70ba 9 \u79d2\uff0c\u524d\u534a\u6bb5\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8f03\u70ba\u986f\u8457\uff0c\u9593\u9694\u505c\u9813\u6642\u9593\u8f03\u4e45\u3002\u5f8c\u534a\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5e45 \ufa01\u8f03\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u6b21\uf969\u589e\u591a\u3002\u53e6\u7a2e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5dee\uf962\u5728\u65bc\u5f8c\u534a\u6bb5\uff0c\u591a\u51fa\u73fe\u4e00\u6b21\u7684\u9ede\u982d\u3002\u5176\u9918\u5c55\u793a \ufa08\u70ba (13.9%)\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u53ea\u51fa\u73fe\u5c55\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u5247\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u5c55\u793a \u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u524d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6216\u6709\u7528\u820c\u982d\u8214\u6a39\u5e79\u7684\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c1a\u5f85\u7814\u6790\u3002", "authors": [{"first_name": "H.-W.", "last_name": "Cheng"}, {"first_name": "S.-Y.", "last_name": "Cheng"}], "source": "Symposium on Animal Behavior and Ecology", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/pushup-behavior-japalura-dragon", "year": 2008, "keywords": ["display", "head-nods", "push-ups", "visual communication"], "type": "conference_proceedings", "id": "d7926b23-12d3-39bd-993a-1b8040e92f96"}, {"title": "Kinematic and kinetic analysis of push-up exercise", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to experimentally measure and analytically determine the load across the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints during push-ups to better understand the nature of this exercise.

We also sought to quantify their impact on spinal loading by calculating spinal compression and torque generation in the L4-5 area. METHODS: Ten university-age participants, nine males and one female, in good to excellent condition, volunteered to participate in this study. All participants were requested to perform a maximum of 12 different push-up exercises, three trials per exercise. Surface electromyographic data (EMG) were collected bilaterally on rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, latissimus dorsi, and erector spinae muscles, and unilaterally (right side) on pectoralis major, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, and anterior deltoid muscles. Spine kinetics were obtained using an anatomically detailed model of the torso/spine. RESULTS: This study revealed that more dynamic push-ups (i.e., ballistic, with hand movement) required more muscle activation and higher spine load, whereas placing labile balls under the hands only resulted in modest increases in spine load. Right rectus abdominis (RA) activation was significantly higher than left RA activation during the left hand forward push-up and vice versa for the right hand forward push-up (P < 0.001). External oblique (EO) demonstrated the same switch in dominance during staggered hand push-ups (P < 0.01). The one-arm push-up resulted in the highest spine compression. Skilled participants showed greater synchronicity with peak muscle activation (plyometric type of contractions) during ballistic push-ups.

Methods: Ten males were recruited from a convenience sample of college students. Surface electromyograms were recorded from the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior and biceps brachii while performing push up exercises with the feet or hands placed on a bench and separately on a Swiss ball. A push up plus exercise was also evaluated with hands on the different support surfaces. Results: There was no statistically significant (p<0.05) difference in mean EMG amplitude on a Swiss ball when compared with the same exercise performed on a bench. Significant differences in muscle activity were seen in the upper trapezius and serratus anterior as a result of changes in foot position relative to hand position irrespective of surface stability. Intepretation: The unstable surface used in this study is not a sufficient condition to generate an increase in muscle activity in select scapulothoracic and glenohumeral muscles during push up exercise variations. Elevating the feet above the hands appeared to have a greater influence on shoulder stabilizing musculature amplitude than the addition of a Swiss ball. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The detection of a planet with period very close to one year critically relied on year-round observation of this circumpolar star. Discovering a planet in a 1 AU orbit around a G dwarf star has prompted us to look more closely at the question of the habitability of the satellites of such planets. Regular satellites orbit all the giant planets in our solar system, suggesting that their formation is a natural by-product of the planet formation process. There is no reason for exomoon formation not to be similarly likely in exoplanetary systems. Moreover, our current understanding of that formation process does not preclude satellite formation in systems where gas giants undergo migration from their formation locations into the terrestrial planet habitable zone. Indeed, regular satellite formation and Type II migration are both linked to the clearing of a gap in the protoplanetary disk by a planet, and so may be inextricably linked. Migration would also multiply the chances of capturing both irregular satellites and Trojan companions sufficiently massive to be habitable. The habitability of such exomoons and exo-Trojans will critically depend on their mass, whether or not they host a magnetosphere, and (for the exomoon case) their orbital radius around the host exoplanet.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79955599182", "issn": "0004-637X", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/732/1/31"}, "source": "\\apj", "authors": [{"first_name": "C.~G.", "last_name": "Tinney"}, {"first_name": "R.~A.", "last_name": "Wittenmyer"}, {"first_name": "R.~P.", "last_name": "Butler"}, {"first_name": "H.~R.~A.", "last_name": "Jones"}, {"first_name": "S.~J.", "last_name": "O'Toole"}, {"first_name": "J.~A.", "last_name": "Bailey"}, {"first_name": "B.~D.", "last_name": "Carter"}, {"first_name": "J", "last_name": "Horner"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/angloaustralian-planet-search-xxi-gasgiant-planet-one-year-orbit-habitability-gasgiant-satellites", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["astrobiology", "planetary systems", "planets and satel"], "type": "journal", "id": "b3e2fcc1-89a8-3317-8434-5193239e7101"}, {"title": "Gravitational anomalies in the solar system?", "abstract": "Mindful of the anomalous perihelion precession of Mercury discovered by Le Verrier in the second half of the nineteenth century and its successful explanation by Einstein with his General Theory of Relativity in the early years of the twentieth century, discrepancies among observed effects in our Solar system and their theoretical predictions on the basis of the currently accepted laws of gravitation applied to known matter-energy distributions have the potential of paving the way for remarkable advances in fundamental physics. This is particularly important now more than ever, given that most of the universe seems to be made of unknown substances dubbed Dark Matter and Dark Energy.

These wind velocities, however, assume solid-body rotation periods based on Voyager 2 measurements of periodic variations in the planets' radio signals and of fits to the planets' magnetic fields; 17.24h and 16.11h for Uranus and Neptune, respectively. The realization that the radio period of Saturn does not represent the planet's deep interior rotation and the complexity of the magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune raise the possibility that the Voyager 2 radio and magnetic periods might not represent the deep interior rotation periods of the ice giants. Moreover, if there is deep differential rotation within Uranus and Neptune no single solid-body rotation period could characterize the bulk rotation of the planets. We use wind and shape data to investigate the rotation of Uranus and Neptune. The shapes (flattening) of the ice giants are not measured, but only inferred from atmospheric wind speeds and radio occultation measurements at a single latitude. The inferred oblateness values of Uranus and Neptune do not correspond to bodies rotating with the Voyager rotation periods. Minimization of wind velocities or dynamic heights of the 1bar isosurfaces, constrained by the single occultation radii and gravitational coefficients of the planets, leads to solid-body rotation periods of ~16.58h for Uranus and ~17.46h for Neptune. Uranus might be rotating faster and Neptune slower than Voyager rotation speeds. We derive shapes for the planets based on these rotation rates. Wind velocities with respect to these rotation periods are essentially identical on Uranus and Neptune and wind speeds are slower than previously thought. Alternatively, if we interpret wind measurements in terms of differential rotation on cylinders there are essentially no residual atmospheric winds. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-77957267789", "issn": "00191035", "arxiv": "1006.3840", "doi": "10.1016/j.icarus.2010.06.037"}, "source": "Icarus", "authors": [{"first_name": "Ravit", "last_name": "Helled"}, {"first_name": "John D.", "last_name": "Anderson"}, {"first_name": "Gerald", "last_name": "Schubert"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/uranus-neptune-shape-rotation", "year": 2010, "keywords": ["Atmospheres, dynamics", "Neptune", "Neptune, atmosphere", "Uranus", "Uranus, atmosphere"], "type": "journal", "id": "6688a610-a012-3a3a-82c6-3cedbe6147b2"}, {"title": "From circular economy to blue economy", "abstract": "Addressing the subject of this essay is based on the background ideas generated by a new branch of science \u2013 Biomimicry. According to European Commissioner for the Environment, \" Nature is the perfect model of circular economy \" . Therefore, by imitating nature, we are witnessing a process of cycle redesign: production-consumption-recycling. The authors present some reflections on the European Commission's decision to adopt after July 1, 2014 new measures concerning the development of more circular economies. Starting from the principles of Ecolonomy, which is based on the whole living paradigm, this paper argues for the development within each economy of entrepreneurial policies related to the Blue economy. In its turn, Blue economy is based on scientific analyses that identify the best solutions in a business. Thus, formation of social capital will lead to healthier and cheaper products, which will stimulate entrepreneurship. Blue economy is another way of thinking economic practice and is a new model of business design. It is a healthy, sustainable business, designed for people. In fact, it is the core of the whole living paradigm through which, towards 2020, circular economy will grow more and more. After the launch at Brussels (december 2012) of the report \" Bankrupting nature \" , there has been an enhancement of the public debate regarding the reconsideration of the way of using resources in a time in which major risks threaten welfare and prosperity. The solution would be reconsidering from the ground of the financial, fiscal and economic model, in view of the planet consolidation. The forseen solution would be the disconnecting of wealth and welfare from the consume of resources. The objective of new models adoption is constituted by efficient capitalization of resources by establishing big taxes when using new raw materials. Hence, reorienting research policy towards innovation as it proposes, for example, biomimicry or blue economy.

A solar day is the interval of time as the sun appears to complete one cycle about a stationary observer on earth. The solar day varies in length through the year.

That history begins with the social lives and rituals of our primate ancestors. As our ancestors' social world grew increasingly complex, their mental powers grew in concert. Among these mental powers was an increasingly sophisticated imagination. A supernatural world filled with gods, spirits, and ancestors was an outgrowth of that imagination-especially children's imagination. Belief in the supernatural provided important adaptive benefits. Religion's initial adaptive benefit was its power to heal. Quickly, though, this benefit was augmented by religion's power to create highly cooperative and cohesive groups. So significant were these benefits that eventually human groups bonded together by religion out-competed all other groups and literally conquered the world. The book argues that at its core, religion is relational-it represents a supernatural extension of the human social world.

Weil uses this language in connection with certain exceptional actions: actions of a kind which are for most of us, most of the time, simply impossible. She is particularly struck by cases in which someone refrains from exercising a power which they have over another: in which, for example, someone refrains from killing or enslaving an enemy who has grievously harmed him and who is now at his mercy. We could also speak of cases in which someone helps an enemy, or a stranger, at very real cost, or risk, to himself. In such cases Weil speaks of the 'supernatural' as being at work.\\n\\nWinch opens his discussion of this aspect of Weil's thought with the question 'What sort of concept is that of the supernatural?' His first response to the question is this: 'We are not of course here in the territory occupied by ghosts, poltergeists, hauntings, spiritualism, and other paranormal pheno mena' (ibid. p. I 9 I). Since many assume that this is precisely the territory of the supernatural, it is worth asking why Winch suggests that it is obvious that it is not. I take it that the answer lies, at least in part, in the fact that to talk of the 'supernatural', as Winch is using that term, is to talk of something which has an importance of a certain kind; and Winch takes it to be obvious that the paranormal does not have that kind of importance.\\n", "identifiers": {"issn": "00344125"}, "source": "Religious Studies ", "authors": [{"first_name": "D", "last_name": "Cockburn"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/supernatural-4", "year": 1992, "keywords": ["Ghost", "Language", "Poltergeist", "Spiritualism", "Supernatural", "Time", "paranormal"], "type": "journal", "id": "2fe191a2-4082-32f0-a64a-69eb1553546c"}, {"title": "Supernatural Agents: Why We Believe in Souls, Gods, and Buddhas", "abstract": "Review of Supernatural Agents: Why We Believe in Souls, Gods and Buddhas, by Illka Pyysi\u00e4inen.

A field experiment was conducted in which twenty-four auditors (partners in international public accounting firms) were asked to review four cases describing real companies that, unknown to the auditors, had perpetrated financial frauds. While many of the auditors failed to detect the manipulations in the cases, a small number of auditors were consistently successful. Since the detection of frauds occurs infrequently in the work of a given auditor, we explain success by the application of powerful heuristics gained from experience with deceptions in everyday life. These heuristics implement a variation of Dennett's intentional stance strategy, which is based on interpreting detected inconsistencies in the light of the Deceiver's (i.e., management's) goals and possible actions. We explain failure to detect deception by means of perturbations (bugs) in the domain knowledge of accounting needed to apply these heuristics to the specific context of financial statement fraud. We test our theory by showing that a computational model of fraud detection that employs the proposed heuristics successfully detects frauds in the cases given to the auditors. We then modify the model by introducing perturbations based on the errors made by each of the auditors in the four cases. The resulting models account for 84 of the 96 observations (i.e., 24 auditors x four cases) in our data. C 2001 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

The aim of the study was to allocate the guidelines of the concept of Olympism of Pierre de Coubertin and prove the statement on the importance of his ideas in relation to the current situation in the Olympic movement. Proceeding from the above, the concept of modern Olympism having been designed by Coubertin can be estimated as a science-based socio-educational project with expressed humanistic orientation, which is of great sociocultural value at present. All the above does not mean that Coubertin designed the ideal concept of the modern Olympism and that it is impossible to find statutes that deserve the critical attitude. It is, for example, exaggeration of the role of education and training in solution of social issues, taking into account the influence of only subjective factors on the social significance of sport, the negative attitude to women's participation in Olympic sport, his controversial stance on the issue of the relationship of sport and politics.

We aimed to analyze the correlation between 3 widely used macrosocioeconomic status indicators and clinical outcomes.\\n\\nMETHODS: We selected population-based studies reporting incident stroke risk and/or 30-day case-fatality according to prespecified criteria. We used 3 macrosocioeconomic status indicators that are consistently defined by international agencies: per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity, total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity, and unemployment rate. We examined the correlation of each macrosocioeconomic status indicator with incident risk of stroke, 30-day case-fatality, proportion of hemorrhagic strokes, and age at stroke onset.\\n\\nRESULTS: Twenty-three articles comprising 30 population-based studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Age-adjusted incident risk of stroke using the standardized World Health Organization World population was associated to lower per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity (\u03c1=-0.661, P=0.027, R(2)=0.32) and total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity (\u03c1=-0.623, P=0.040, R(2)=0.26). Thirty-day case-fatality rates and proportion of hemorrhagic strokes were also related to lower per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity and total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity. Moreover, stroke occurred at a younger age in populations with low per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity and total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity. There was no correlation between unemployment rates and outcome measures.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Lower per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity and total health expenditures per capita at purchasing power parity were associated with higher incident risk of stroke, higher case-fatality, a greater proportion of hemorrhagic strokes, and lower age at stroke onset. As a result, these macrosocioeconomic status indicators may be used as proxy measures of quality of primary prevention and acute care and considered as important factors for developing strategies aimed at improving worldwide stroke care.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84855353266", "pmid": "22033985", "issn": "00392499", "isbn": "0039-2499", "doi": "10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.632158"}, "source": "Stroke", "authors": [{"first_name": "Luciano A.", "last_name": "Sposato"}, {"first_name": "Gustavo", "last_name": "Saposnik"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/gross-domestic-product-health-expenditure-associated-incidence-30day-fatality-age-stroke-onset-syste", "year": 2012, "keywords": ["employment", "gross domestic product", "health expenditure", "mortality", "socioeconomic status", "stroke incidence"], "type": "generic", "id": "2e604b09-768d-354d-944e-351779e2c7b5"}, {"title": "The Automotive Industry in Germany", "abstract": "Germany is the first producer and consumer of cars in Europe; the first invester in R&D in automobiles in the world.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84885104230"}, "source": "Germany Trade & Invest", "authors": [{"first_name": "Germany Trade &", "last_name": "Invest"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/automotive-industry-germany", "year": 2013, "type": "journal", "id": "e7133dd3-cdde-39f2-95fd-3573cfda9d17"}, {"title": "New Directions in 3D User Interfaces", "abstract": "Three-dimensional user interfaces (3D UIs) support user tasks in many non-traditional interactive systems such as virtual environments and augmented reality.

Very few fundamentally new techniques and metaphors for 3D interaction have been discovered in recent years, yet the usability of 3D UIs in many real-world applications is still not at a desirable level. What directions should 3D UI researchers next explore to improve this situation? In this paper, we make some observations about the history of 3D UIs and the current state-of-the-art. Using this evidence, in addition to our own experience, we argue that 3D UI researchers should approach this problem using some new research approaches, which cluster around the concepts of specificity, flavors, implementation, and emerging technologies.

Drawing on the case of East Germany, propositions are suggested about how these four conditions change as a result of the transformation process, and about their differential impact on protest over time.

Seventy female Wistar rats of 3 months of age were divided into four groups as follows: group 1: control animals; group 2: ovariectomized animals; group 3: ovariectomized animals undergoing treatment with estrogen (0.25 mg/kg per week of 17-?? estradiol); group 4: ovariectomized rats undergoing estrogen treatment only during the last 3 months of the experimental period. No significant differences were found among the groups in regard to the BMD values of the caudal vertebrae at either 3 or 6 months. Likewise, in the lumbar vertebrae there were no significant differences among the groups after 3 months. However, at 6 months, a decrease in the BMDs of the ovariectomized animals with respect to the remaining groups was found: 226 ?? 11 mg/cm2 in the ovariectomized group; 262 ?? 14 mg/cm2 in the controls; 255 ?? 4 mg/cm2 in the rats receiving estrogen treatment for 6 months; and 259 ?? 5 mg/ cm2 in the animals receiving estrogen for 3 months. The study also reveals the absence of differences in the bone mineral density between the ovariectomized and control rats when the former received estrogen treatment. According to the changes in bone remodeling, the ovariectomized rats showed an increase in the hydroxyproline/creatinine and Ca++/creatinine ratios; this increase is accompanied by an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin levels. In summary, measurement of the BMD in rats by the DXA method permits detection of loss of bone mineral density occurring in certain zones of the axial skeleton at 6 months after ovariectomy. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science Inc.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0029164618", "pmid": "7626317", "issn": "87563282", "doi": "10.1016/S8756-3282(95)80169-3"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "Carmen", "last_name": "Garcia-Moreno"}, {"first_name": "Olga M.", "last_name": "Calvo"}, {"first_name": "Saturnino", "last_name": "Herrero"}, {"first_name": "Esther", "last_name": "Martin"}, {"first_name": "Bego??a", "last_name": "Suqu??a"}, {"first_name": "Jos??

Fifty-three Sprague-Dawley female rats were OVX or shamoperated at 19 months of age, and divided into 6 groups: (I) sham-operated controls; (II) OVX vehicle controls; (III) OVX rats treated with E2 at 30 ??g/kg/day; (IV)-(VI) OVX rats treated with DRO at either 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg p.o. daily. The treatment period was 8 weeks. Static and dynamic cancellous bone histomorphometric parameters were determined on 4 and 10 ??m thick, undecalcified, double-fluorescent labeled sections of the fourth lumbar vertebral body. Changes in body weight, uterine weight, and total serum cholesterol were also determined. OVX for 8 weeks in 19-month-old female rats resulted in reduced trabecular bone volume (-18%) and trabecular width (-10%) and increased labeling perimeter (+52%), bone formation rate/ bone surface referent (+60%), bone formation rate/bone volume referent (+77%), osteoclast number (+41%), and osteoclast perimeter (+41%). E2 treatment at 30 ??g/kg/day for 8 weeks prevented OVX-induced cancellous bone loss and decreased bone resorption, bone formation, and bone turnover to the values of sham controls. DRO at 2.5-10 mg/kg/ day completely prevented bone loss and bone turnover associated with estrogen deficiency. Osteoclast number and perimeter were significantly decreased in DRO-treated-OVX rats compared to both sham and OVX controls. Trabecular bone volume, trabecular width, labeling perimeter, bone formation rate/bone surface referent, and bone formation rate/ bone volume referent showed no differences in DRO-treated OVX rats compared to those of E2-treated OVX rats and sham controls. These histomorphometric results indicated that DRO is an estrogen agonist on cancellous bone of lumbar vertebral bodies of aged, OVX rats. Further, E2 treatment prevented the OVX-induced increase in body weight gain and nonsignificantly reduced total serum cholesterol compared to OVX controls. Body weight gain and total serum cholesterol did not differ between OVX rats treated with E2 and sham controls. In OVX rats treated with DRO, body weight decreased significantly in a dose-response manner, and total serum cholesterol was significantly reduced by 65% to 70% compared to both sham and OVX controls. In addition, treatment with E2 increased uterine weight to the value of sham controls in OVX rats. However, DRO had no effect on uterine weight at either 2.5 or 10 mg/kg/day, while it only slightly but significantly increased uterine weight over OVX controls at 5 mg/kg/day. We conclude that DRO was efficacious in the prevention of lumbar vertebral cancellous bone loss and in the decline of total serum cholesterol but had no effect on uterine weight in the aged, OVX female rats. Our data suggest that DRO is a potentially useful agent for the prevention of vertebral bone loss leading to spinal fractures in postmenopausal women. ?? 1995.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0028857870", "pmid": "8579962", "issn": "87563282", "doi": "10.1016/8756-3282(95)00346-2"}, "source": "Bone", "authors": [{"first_name": "H.

Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD \u2264 2.0 \u00c5 for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

It was made clear that climate forecasts must be phrased as probabilistic statements, The concept of a general integrated systems approach to applying forecasts across a range of scale from farm to region and nation was introduced. This concept focussed on deriving the targeted information needs of decision-makers in a manner that captured the value of the climate forecast. It was suggested that, as the climate forecast only acquired value when decisions were modified in response to it, then a focus on decision-making in the target systems was an appropriate basis to structure the contributions to this book. While systems across the range of scale involved diverse decision-makers and issues ranging from resource management to policy, the general approach was relevant in all cases. The aim of this paper is to synthesise key issues fi-om those contributions and to discuss them in a way that might guide future activities. The contributions reviewed developments in seasonal climate forecasting and presented details of on-going work aimed at applying climate forecasts in relation to farm, regional, and national scale agricultural decisions and possibilities in natural systems. Numerous issues were raised from the insights presented. Five key issues are presented and discussed here as they represent the most common threads, These issues are - Understanding and predicting responses of the target system is critical. Applications are about managing risks Information must be relevant to decision-makers Communication of probabilistic information can be problematic Connecting agricultural and climate models needs to be considered In discussing these key issues the major general need was a focus on implications of decision options in the target system in a way that the unexplained variability of the imprecise forecast was retained so that risk implications for modified decisions could be explored transparently and communicated simply and effectively. It was suggested that coupling of the key players in the entire applications milieu - practitioners, analysts, modellers, researchers - was essential for future progress in this regard. The various players each have their own models and behaviours, which contribute some unique elements. While these models have a degree of utility in their own right, it is argued that the dialogue they generate among the disparate players is equally important to effective applications of climate forecasting.

His views on international diplomacy cover the most important aspects of British, European and American foreign policy concerns of the century, including the origins and consequences of the two world wars, the disarmament movement, the origins and early course of the Cold War and the first steps towards European integration. His experience of the First World War and the huge loss of life it entailed provoked Cecil to spend his life championing the ethos behind and work of the League of Nations: a role for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1937. Yet despite his prominence in the international peace movement, Cecil has never been the focus of an academic biography. Cecil has perhaps been judged unfairly due to his association with the League of Nations, which has since been generally regarded as a failure. However, recent academic research has highlighted the contribution of the League to the creation of many of the institutions and precepts that have, since the Second World War, become accepted parts of the international system, not least the United Nations. In particular, Cecil and his work on arms control lay the basis for understanding this new area of international activity, which would bear fruit during the Cold War and after. Through an evaluation of Cecil's political career, the book also assesses his reputation as an idealist and the extent to which he had a coherent philosophy of international relations. This book suggests that in reality Cecil was a Realpolitiker pragmatist whose attitudes evolved during two key periods: The interwar period and the Cold War. It also proposes that where a coherent philosophy was in evidence, it owed as much to the moral and political code of the Cecil family as to his own experiences in politics. Cecil's social and familial world is therefore considered alongside his more public life. \u00a9 Gaynor Johnson 2013.

These errors are: 1 The failure to distinguish between tech-niques used to measure past financial performance and those required to establish future performance objee-tives. 2 The failure to differentiate between sys-tems that measure the performance of the profit eenter and those that measure the performance of its managers. 3 The failure to segment variances from the budget by differences in the way that managers can influence them.

The crux of Dr. Ariole\u2019s argument is that Nigerian, and indeed African universities which operate under different circumstances from other universities in the world, should not have been placed in the same category as the Harvards, Yales, MITs and Oxfords in the global rankings. He cited the familiar reasons of poor funding and lack of recognition of graduates of Nigerian universities by the government and local employers of labour.  Dr. Ariole\u2019s teaching job at the University of Lagos makes him an insider, and also places him in a much better position to assess problems within the university system in Nigeria, many of which concerned stakeholders have long acknowledged. In his Guardian newspaper column of Sunday October 9th 2005, titled, The Revolt of the Universities, Reuben Abati, Chairman of the editorial board of the Guardian newspaper said that, \u201cfor years, corporate Nigeria has complained bitterly about the intrusion into the labour market of a generation of Nigerian university graduates who have nothing in their brains, but are very adept if they are female, in the arts of seduction and nudity, and if they are male, they tend to see the work-place as a cult where merit can be compromised. It is however a pity that there is a disconnect in the school-to-work transition in Nigeria, but this can be corrected and one way of doing it is to make sure that the products of our university system are good enough.\u201d Mr. Abati is hereby pointing accusatory fingers at university teachers.   Although one appreciates Dr. Ariole\u2019s argument over the \u2018lumping together\u2019 of world universities in the rankings, one is at the same time concerned over Dr. Ariole\u2019s suggestion that a different set of criteria be used in assessing Nigerian and African universities. This is because such an approach may not fit into the market model of education which he partially referred to in his essay. Asking for some kind of differential treatment in the ratings for Nigerian and African universities portends even greater danger for the educational system as that may not allow for any kind of benchmarking, which ordinarily would have inspired quality improvement in the non-performing universities. This is also not what the peer review mechanism is all about.   A university remains a university no matter where it is located, even if in Enugwu-Ukwu or Ijebu Ode; its output should be evaluated against the outputs of other universities anywhere in the world. It is like paying for a Mercedes Benz automobile in Nigeria and expect that the standard of performance it would give you should be less than what the same model will give to a purchaser in Europe or in America. A rating system, the type of which is being advocated by Dr. Ariole could amount to service providers (universities) short-changing those that are paying for the services (the students).   Perhaps Dr. Ariole would agree that globalisation; a by-product of the market model which has seen the increasing convergence of global markets, economies and values has led to the commoditisation of education. Therefore asking that Nigerian and African universities, despite the peculiar challenges they face, be judged and assessed differently from other world universities may further lead to the worsening of conditions, and depreciation in value and image of the quality of education provided by Nigerian and African universities, in the eyes of the international community.   Things are already bad enough as they are, especially with the third world/first world classifications. Nigerian and African universities will not be doing themselves any favours if they further allow themselves to be pushed to a corner, and tagged with the \u2018third world education providers\u2019 label as Dr. Ariole is suggesting.  Nigerians may not like what they see at the moment, but it may be a blessing in disguise if the poor showing of Nigerian universities in the World University rankings will eventually lead to improvement in standards. Nigerian Academics, government officials and other concerned stakeholders should see the non-inclusion of Nigerian universities in the global rankings as a challenge. It is only through a resolve to change for good that Nigerian universities may eventually emerge from the doldrums where they currently find themselves.   Students who are the major stakeholders and ultimate beneficiaries of educational services provided by Nigerian universities may not be helped in the long term by Dr. Ariole\u2019s suggestions. This is because if Nigerian universities which awarded their degree certificates are ranked differently from other universities, it may lead to such students being ridiculed by their peers at international forums. The students may also be disadvantaged in their quest for graduate admission places in top global universities because such a system which Dr. Ariole advocates would already have created a \u2018third rate\u2019 impression in the minds of international university admission officers, likewise multinational corporations\u2019 recruiters.   Perhaps what may be required at this point is some kind of soul searching by all concerned stakeholders on the way forward; it appears the buck has been passed around for so long. A situation where no Nigerian University was listed among the top 500 universities in the world in the 2007 THES \u2013 QS World University Rankings with the University of Cape Town, South-Africa as the only African university in the top 500 can not be acceptable and speaks volumes of the extent of decay in the system. Only four Nigerian Universities made the list, as against the five that made the list 2006. The four universities are Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife (44th), the University of Ibadan (65th), the University of Benin (79th) and the University of Lagos (90th). The place of Nigerian universities in the African rankings is more pathetic because they trail behind some universities from Kenya, South Africa, and Ghana, countries endowed with fewer natural resources  It may appear that Professor Peter Okebukola\u2019s (former Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission - NUC) dreams that Nigerian universities should \u201cbe at the heart of efforts at realising the presidential vision that by the year 2020, Nigeria should be one of the world\u2019s top 20 economies\u201d will remain just that, dreams.   It is about time that the university system, particularly the lecturers look inwards to find a way out of the crises that has crippled the system. Constant strikes by the lecturers under their umbrella union (ASUU) may not be helping matters. In a Keynote address delivered at the First Bank Annual Undergraduate Essay and Secondary School Quiz Competitions Award ceremony in Lagos in 2006, Professor Peter Okebukola said that \u201cBetween 1993 and 2003, the (university) system witnessed 36 months of total closure. Add this to over-enrolment and establishment of satellite campuses, as a means of generating more funds to meet shortfalls in proprietor provision.\u201d Okebukola also submitted that \u201covercrowding of our universities with mediocre students accounts, in large part, for many of the social vices on our campuses such as examination malpractice, cultism and \u2018sorting\u2019, one of the major causes of poor quality graduates.\u201d  While the lecturers allege lack of funding as the main factor affecting standards, the government allege otherwise. At a meeting with the members of the Committee of Vice Chancellors (CVC) of Nigerian universities in 2005, former Minister of Education (Chinwe Nora Obaji) blamed the problems on \u201cmanagerial inadequacies and indiscipline\u201d. Mrs. Obaji said that these have now caused other problems including \u201cover population caused by over- enrolment, poor maintenance culture, poor sanitary situations, low quality teaching, examination malpractices, late admissions, \u2018sorting\u2019 (students bribing lecturers to pass the course), cultism and other social vices, views shared by Professor Peter Okebukola.   In a Keynote address at the First Bank Annual Undergraduate Essay and Secondary School Quiz Competitions Award ceremony in Lagos in 2006, Professor Okebukola remarked that there has been a phenomenal increase in university funding. \u201cLast year (2005), they (universities) got N54 billion and N76 billion this year (2006). But we are not there yet. So, the universities continue to play Oliver Twist.\u201d Continuing, he said that former president Olusegun Obasanjo, \u201cmade N21 billion available for the completion of abandoned academic buildings, introduced a special grant for the purchase of consumables for practical work and beginning last year (2006), approved the release of special grant of N3 billion for the purchase of new equipment for laboratories and workshops.\u201d Okebukola predicted that this will continue for the next five years. What remains to be seen is if the facilities and structures on ground in the universities reflect such budgetary increases.   The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) however disagrees. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna in June 2007 over the current ASUU strike, Chairman, Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) branch of ASUU, Muazu Maiwada, expressed regrets that government of former President Olusegun Obasanjo was insensitive to the dwindling fortunes of the nation\u2019s education sector. According to Maiwada, \u201cefforts to resolve the current impasse had failed to yield fruits, because government's negotiation team and ASUU leadership could not reach consensus.\u201d  \u201cASUU is not on strike because of consolidated salary as former President Olusegun Obasanjo mischievously misinformed Nigerians.

The prophetic paradigm is the method used to analyze whether he closed the gap between existential reality and idealism, especially for those who were on the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder. Lincoln's values, criticisms of the established order, constitutional actions, and continuous prophetic scrutiny and futuristic projections with regard to his policies on slavery, Native Americans, economics, and the military determine his success. His words, actions, and the research of nationally recognized Lincoln scholars provide the material for this study. The dissertation challenges the argument that Lincoln was a man of his time who did not move the United States towards a more perfect union.                 The Biblical values of freedom, justice, love, prosperity for all, and peace are evident in the criticism Lincoln voiced towards the established order in slavery, economic policies, and the military.

Coming on the heels of the visit of the controversial Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to Ghana last week, the New Statesman can confirm that Germany\u2019s Vice Chancellor, who also doubles as Foreign Minister, Guido Westerwelle, who is gay, is scheduled to visit Ghana soon to hold talks with President Mahama. Mr Westerwelle made the news in September 2010 after formalizing his union with his long-term partner and businessman Michael Mronz in Bonn. Westerwelle, 51, and his 46-year old partner Mronz, who organises sports events, met in 2003 and have been a couple ever since. Unconfirmed reports reaching the New Statesman indicates that John Mahama\u2019s liberal disposition towards the gay community enabled him get money to run his 2012 presidential campaign. Upon assuming office, President Mahama has had to apologise to gay pal and lobbyist, Andrew Solomon, a day after his Information Minister, Mahama Ayariga, put out obviously incorrect information about the relationship between President Mahama and Mr Solomon. Having known President Mahama for eight years, Andrew Solomon has called on President John Mahama to take a lead role in promoting gay and lesbian's rights in the West African sub-region. Solomon says the mere fact that there is a national debate on gays and lesbian rights in Ghana, even if the debate is to have gays lynched, is a meaningful progress for him. \u201cWhen my husband-to-be (John Habich) and I met the Ghanaian politician John Dramani Mahama at a friend\u2019s wedding near Accra eight years ago, I liked him immediately,\u201d explained Andrew Solomon in his Op-ed write-up in the New York Times. According to Mr Solomon, when President Mahama\u2019s equally controversial book, \u2018My First Coup d\u2019Etat\u2019, was published in the United States, he did some publicity for his friend\u2019s book.

Those once declared the \"new breed\" who would lead Africa to a brighter future - such as Uganda's Yoweri Museveni and Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi - fell from favour when they failed to live up to the promise. But one country, Mozambique, continues to shine in the eyes of Downing Street. Its president, Armando Guebuza, arrives in London today looking for more money. He is to meet Mr Blair, and the international development secretary, Hilary Benn - a man he feels so familiar with he refers to him simply as Hilary. Mozambique is held up as an example of what a combination of free market economics and foreign aid can do for a poor country. After a long war conducted by rebels backed by South Africa's apartheid regime, it has enjoyed more than a decade of economic growth that in some years has risen above 10%. Millions of people have been helped out of absolute poverty, far more children are in school, particularly girls, and much greater access to health care has halved the number of women dying in childbirth. Yet Mozambique relies on $1bn of foreign aid each year, a good proportion of it from Britain, to prop up an economy worth just $6bn. More than half the national budget comes from foreign donors. Economists say that while foreign investment is up, it is mostly in areas that provide few jobs. Mozambique's single largest export remains the same as it was through its years of Marxist economics - cashew nuts. Even Mr Guebuza, a former political commissar turned ardent and wealthy free marketeer, is reluctant to claim that it is the market rather than the aid that is delivering. \"It's quite a question. Our budget today depends mostly on donations or credit from outside, around 50%. That means we are still not self-sufficient. Our deficit is too high. We depend on what countries like Britain can do for us ... We consider it very, very important for us for it to continue but we need more,\" he said. The relationship between London and Maputo has been unusually close over the past three decades given that Mozambique was not a British colony, a relationship built on the unlikely friendship between Margaret Thatcher and the then Marxist leader, Samora Machel. In 1995, Mozambique became the first country without some form of constitutional link to the UK to join the Commonwealth. Now Mr Guebuza is an enthusiastic champion of Mr Blair's Africa commission. Mozambique's prime minister, Luisa Diogo, received a standing ovation at the last Labour party conference. Mr Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, have both travelled to the country. Yet critics of Britain's emphasis on aid-driven growth, who include leading figures in the World Bank, believe that it also fuels corruption and bad governance and so undermines the goal of building a sound and solid economy. Mr Guebuza acknowledges that corruption has grown as spectacularly as the economy. \"The problem of corruption cannot be seen just as moral issues. It depends also on the economic situation. Poor people are more vulnerable to corruption although we have many rich people who are also corrupt,\" he said. Despite public pledges to move against the \"let it walk\" mentality, there have been no major investigations or arrests since Mr Guebuza came to power last year. To some there are signs that the faith Britain places in Mozambique's leaders may prove to be as misplaced as the belief invested in others among the \"new breed\" in Africa. The US state department recently criticised the ruling Frelimo party's domination of all branches of government and its lack of accountability. Mr Guebuza, meantime, is displaying some of his old political tendencies by reinvigorating the intelligence service to keep an eye on his opponents. Three decades ago, Mr Guebuza was party to some of Frelimo's worst abuses. As the interior minister of the newly independent country in 1975, he helped drive out almost all the white settlers and people of Indian origin. Eight years later he oversaw the roundup of \"undesirables\" in Maputo, who were forcibly shipped to remote areas where many died. In the 1980s he was allegedly party to the secret decision to shoot Frelimo dissidents. Over the past decade he has made a fortune by becoming a \"stakeholder\" in large companies by providing foreign investors wanting to do business in Mozambique with a well-connected partner. Some investors have complained that it is the only way to do business in the country. Mr Guebuza says there is no contradiction in his switch from political commissar to one of the richest men in Mozambique. \"There's no conflict. The liberation struggle was a process of learning, of absorbing and also of rejecting. All along we understood that we need to provide services to people like education, water, good infrastructure,\" he said. \"We thought at the beginning that we can do that through a system under which the government will own everything. But time has taught us that that was not possible.\"", "authors": [{"first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "McGreal"}], "source": "Guardian UK", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/mozambiques-president-visits-uk-search-aid", "year": 2006, "type": "newspaper_article", "id": "5392893a-0cdd-3413-b3e4-dbe33a7b6f9a"}, {"title": "Europe Launches 200,000 Computer Research Grid Infrastructure ZDNet UK", "abstract": "The European Commission has launched a project designed to give researchers access to a distributed computing network of 200,000 desktop computers.", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jack", "last_name": "Clark"}], "source": "ZDNet UK", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/europe-launches-200000-computer-research-grid-infrastructure-zdnet-uk", "year": 2010, "keywords": ["EGI", "Free Fulltext", "IDGF", "News"], "type": "journal", "id": "202803e0-7b8b-33cc-90a6-11fd00c414e2"}, {"title": "Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy", "abstract": "The WFD is the most substantial piece of water legislation ever produced by the European Commission, and will provide the major driver for achieving sustainable management of water in the UK and other EU Member States for many years to come.

Next, we established that the discrepancy between the objective of parties and the objective of the electorate leads to inefficient conservatism in the selection of candidates, i.e. each party keeps its incumbents too often from the voters' viewpoint. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

They received Royal Assent on 8 November 2006 and come into effect on 1 March 2007 (subject to a few exceptions). All those who refer to the law governing the NHS need to make sure that, where necessary, they replace their earlier copies of statutes with the three new Acts before the need to look at sources of legislation.  The new Acts are:  The National Health Service Act 2006; The National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 The National Health Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 2006 National Health Service Act 2006 (as a webpage, on the OPSI website) (opens new window) Download National Health Service Act 2006 (PDF, 1087K) National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 (as a webpage, on the OPSI website) (opens new window) Download National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 (PDF, 799K) National Health Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 2006 (as a webpage, on the OPSI website) (opens new window) Download National Health Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 2006 (PDF, 416K) Why we need consolidation of NHS law Health legislation is a complex area that has required frequent amendments in order to keep policies in line with evolving circumstances. The last health legislation consolidation was in 1977 and numerous subsequent statutory changes and the context of devolution require a further consolidation.  The current consolidation will make the law clearer, especially in relation to the divergence of health law between England and Wales.  What consolidation means The consolidation makes no substantial changes to the substance of the law. The statutes contained within the new Acts have been re-ordered and inconsistencies in the legislation removed. We have repealed obsolete provisions using a pre-consolidation amendment order.  The Pre-consolidation Order has passed debates in both Houses and was made on 25 May 2006 (S.I. 2006 No. 1407). The Order makes minor, technical changes. It addresses an ambiguity concerning the meaning of the term \u2018facilities\u2019 in section 3 of the 1977 Act. This follows a Court of Appeal decision reversing an earlier court judgement that narrowly construed the term and thereby risked adversely affecting the funding of services. The Order also remedies missed consequential provisions, manages drafting concerning Local Health Boards of Wales, and repeals provisions that are either spent or unnecessary. The Order also removes certain requirements for Treasury consent before the Secretary of State for Health can make certain small payments, such as committee expenses.  Scope of consolidation The consolidation repeals and re-enacts in its entirety the National Health Service Act 1977, which was itself a consolidation. It also incorporates provisions from:  Health Act 2006 Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002 Health and Social Care Act 2001 Health Act 1999 Primary Care Act 1997 Health Authorities Act 1995 National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.", "authors": [{"last_name": "NHS Act"}], "source": "UK", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/national-health-service-act-1", "year": 2006, "keywords": ["Benefits EndNote Library", "NEL OOH"], "type": "statute", "id": "8242416c-ae74-307c-b3c6-66a82e5728b3"}, {"title": "Is politician A or politician B more persuasive?

Leaving Fort Kamloops the brigade went on to Fort Alexandria, where the horses were changed for boats. The journey was also up-stream on the Nechako and Stuart rivers. Douglas went up the Nechako to Fort Fraser, on Fraser Lake, and probably went overland\\nfrom there to Fort St. James.\\nAfter a very brief stay at Fort St. James, during which he took some observations, he and Johnson embarked in a small birch-bark canoe and descended the Stuart and Nechako rivers. At Fort George they stayed\\na day or two with George Linton, clerk in charge there, and then began descending the Fraser. And now disaster was added to disappointment. On June 13, at the \u201d Stony Islands,\u201d as he called them, they were wrecked\\nin the rapids; the canoe was smashed to pieces. Douglas was carried down the rapids and into the whirlpool below, and he was swept about in the\\nturbulent waters for an hour and forty minutes, before being washed on to the rocky shore. He lost everything he had except his instruments, his astronomical journal, notes and charts, and his barometrical observations.\\nThe last months of Douglas's life were spent in the Sandwich Islands. He arrived in Honolulu in December, 1833, and spent the next few months in exploring the island of Hawaii. He\\ncollected a large number of ferns. The two great volcanic peaks attracted him and he climbed both, being the first white man to do so. As usual, he endured terrible hardships. In August, 1834, while crossing the island alone with his dog he fell into a pit used for trapping wild cattle, and was gored to death. Some say he was pushed in, and in this way murdered\\nfor his money. Whichever it was, it was a horrible death, and\\nan untimely one, for he was only 34 years old.\\nAs the pioneer botanist of North-west America and California, Douglas made their flora known to the world. The number of plants which he introduced to England in the form of root, seed,\\nor cutting is remarkable. Other collectors have contributed more\\nto botanical knowledge or made more extensive collections, but none has contributed more to our stock of beautiful and hardy plants than he.", "authors": [{"first_name": "A G", "last_name": "Harvey"}], "source": "British Columbia Historical Quarterly", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/david-douglas-british-columbia", "year": 1940, "keywords": ["biographical_information", "botanical_description", "david_douglas", "exploration"], "type": "journal", "id": "def3f7c6-fab6-3346-a035-f65d0ea44c47"}, {"title": "BRITISH COLUMBIA - TASK FORCE ON CORRECTIONAL SERVICES FACILITIES", "abstract": "THE EXTEND AND NATURE OF CRIME IS REVIEWED AND FOUND TO BE INCREASING AT AN ALARMING RATE.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up of patients with subclinical demyelinating lesions that fulfill the Barkhof/Tintor\u00e9 criteria. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Fifty-three women and 17 men with subclinical demyelinating lesions (mean age, 35.63 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid, MRI, and visual evoked potential measurements. METHODS: All patients underwent their first brain MRI for various medical problems that were not suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). The patients' physicians proposed that they undergo paraclinical studies (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and visual evoked potential analysis) and follow-up with MRI. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (33%) had clinical conversion: 6 to optic neuritis, 6 to myelitis, 5 to brainstem symptoms, 4 to sensitive symptoms, 1 to cerebellar symptoms, and 1 to cognitive deterioration. The mean time between the first brain MRI and the first clinically isolated syndrome was 2.3 years (range, 0.8-5.0 years). Twelve patients had been treated with immunomodulators after a clinically isolated syndrome. Examination of pejorative markers for clinical conversion showed that sex, number of T2 lesions, presence of oligoclonal bands, and IgG index were not statistically different in patients with MS determined by MRI compared with clinically definite MS. Visual evoked potential abnormalities, young age, and gadolinium enhancement on follow-up MRI were more frequent in clinically definite MS than in MS determined by MRI. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, we determined the rate of clinical conversion (33%) during a mean follow-up of 5.2 years. To our knowledge, this is the first clinically isolated syndrome cohort with preclinical follow-up. Early treatment of these patients with MS determined by MRI should be discussed.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-67650505036", "pmid": "19597085", "issn": "1538-3687", "isbn": "1538-3687 (Electronic)\\r0003-9942 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1001/archneurol.2009.119"}, "source": "Archives of neurology", "authors": [{"first_name": "Christine", "last_name": "Lebrun"}, {"first_name": "Caroline", "last_name": "Bensa"}, {"first_name": "Marc", "last_name": "Debouverie"}, {"first_name": "Sandrine", "last_name": "Wiertlevski"}, {"first_name": "David", "last_name": "Brassat"}, {"first_name": "Jerome", "last_name": "de Seze"}, {"first_name": "Lucien", "last_name": "Rumbach"}, {"first_name": "Jean", "last_name": "Pelletier"}, {"first_name": "Pierre", "last_name": "Labauge"}, {"first_name": "Bruno", "last_name": "Brochet"}, {"first_name": "Ayman", "last_name": "Tourbah"}, {"first_name": "Pierre", "last_name": "Clavelou"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/association-between-clinical-conversion-multiple-sclerosis-radiologically-isolated-syndrome-magnetic", "year": 2009, "type": "journal", "id": "d8704fbb-33f4-324c-a8fe-c564ac65ba6b"}, {"title": "Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Central Nervous System Tumors", "abstract": "Brain tumors are one of the most common neoplasms in young adults and are associated with a high mortality and disability rate.

High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) has a beneficial clinical effect; reduces gadolinium enhancement, indicating improvement of BBB integrity; and, in MS patients, decreases intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis with reduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) myelin basic protein (MBP). A correlative triad is noted between gadolinium enhancement, clinical improvement, and decrease of CSF MBP following MP treatment, indicating a relationship between restoration BBB integrity, clinical improvement and decrease of myelin breakdown. It is not clear whether MP interferes primarily with the process of demyelination or reacts non-specifically with its mediators. ?? 1992.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0026709574", "pmid": "1430156", "issn": "01655728", "isbn": "0165-5728 (Print)\\r0165-5728 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1016/0165-5728(92)90142-8"}, "source": "Journal of Neuroimmunology", "authors": [{"first_name": "Stephan T F M", "last_name": "Frequin"}, {"first_name": "Frederik", "last_name": "Barkhof"}, {"first_name": "Karel J B", "last_name": "Lamers"}, {"first_name": "Otto R.", "last_name": "Hommes"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/effects-highdose-methylprednisolone-gadoliniumenhanced-magnetic-resonance-imaging-cerebrospinal-flui", "year": 1992, "keywords": ["Cerebrospinal fluid", "Gadolinium", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Methylprednisolone", "Multiple sclerosis", "Myelin basic protein"], "type": "journal", "id": "b823bde1-ea27-3367-97de-1383214057bc"}, {"title": "Somatosensory evoked potential, neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of cervical spinal cord decompression", "abstract": "The present study was designed to determine the relationship between neurological testing, anatomical imaging, and electrophysiological monitoring for assessing outcome of cervical spinal cord decompression.

The plan outlines the structural changes and initiatives to be implemented during 2000/2001 in achieving the aims of the strategy. Internationally, the plan will implement efforts to reduce the availability of controlled drugs entering the United Kingdom. Nationally, a Strategic Planning Board will be established to coordinate and monitor the progress of the strategy, and a new National Treatment Agency will be created to be responsible for the expansion of drug treatment provision and for ensuring the delivery of high quality services in England. Regionally, the Home Office Drugs Prevention Advisory Service will be expanded to address all four aims of the strategy. Locally, there will be a reorganization of Drug Action Teams in England to align all of them with local authority boundaries, thus increasing the number of teams and enhancing their cooperation with other local groups concerned about drug abuse.

Revising the standard narratives of American and West German social mobilization, Martin Klimke demonstrates the strong transnational connections between New Left groups on both sides of the Atlantic. Klimke shows that the cold war partnership of the American and German governments was mirrored by a coalition of rebelling counterelites, whose common political origins and opposition to the Vietnam War played a vital role in generating dissent in the United States and Europe. American protest techniques such as the \"sit-in\" or \"teach-in\" became crucial components of the main organization driving student activism in West Germany--the German Socialist Student League--and motivated American and German student activists to construct networks against global imperialism. Klimke traces the impact that Black Power and Germany's unresolved National Socialist past had on the German student movement; he investigates how U.S. government agencies, such as the State Department's Interagency Youth Committee, advised American policymakers on confrontations with student unrest abroad; and he highlights the challenges student protesters posed to cold war alliances. Exploring the catalysts of cross-pollination between student protest movements on two continents, The Other Alliance is a pioneering work of transnational history. \u00a9 2010 by Princeton University Press.

The subjects were representatively selected from the regional registration offices with regard to age, gender and community size. The first survey for adults (GerES I) was carried out in 1985/1986 (West Germany) followed by GerES IIa in 1990/1991 (West Germany) and GerES IIb in 1991/1992 (East Germany). In GerES II children were also included to some extent. In 1998, the third GerES for adults was conducted in both parts of Germany (GerES III). The current survey 2003/2006 (GerES IV) is focussing exclusively on children. A 1-year pilot study was conducted in 2001-2002 to collect information on parameters influencing the response rate and to test the suitability of the different instruments intended to be used for the main study. The main goal of the surveys is to analyse and document the extent, distribution and determinants of exposure to environmental pollutants of the German general population. Three main instruments of investigation were comprised in GerES: human biomonitoring (HBM), monitoring of the domestic environment, and collecting information on exposure pathways and living conditions via questionnaires. This paper is focussed on the general design of the GerESs, the trend over time and spatial differences (West Germany and East Germany) for HBM data on arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, pentachlorophenol (PCP), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). These substances have been determined in blood and/or morning urine of adults and children.

The European Council, meeting in Brussels in March 2008, agreed on the objective of removing barriers to the free movement of knowledge by creating a 'fifth freedom' which, inter alia, would involve increased cross-border mobility of researchers, as well as students, scientists and university teaching staff. 3.

Therefore, the\\nauthor has regarded as useful and topical an exploration of the\\nsignificance of that theory for the conditions of transformation of the\\nCzechoslovak economy.\\nFulfilling this intention relies on the one hand on an explanation of\\nthe intellectual basis of the theory of PPP, the circumstances of its\\norigin, and its concept both in the absolute and relative versions of\\nthe theory: on the other hand, the author also uses an analysis of\\nstandard objections against the theory's declarative ability that appear\\nin the literature. From the objections it follows that the theory is not\\na general one, capable to explain changes of the exchange rate in both\\nthe short- and long- run. The theory clarifies formation of the exchange\\nrate of a given currency during long-term economic development, i. e., a\\nnatural long-term equilibrating tendency of the rate which is realized\\nthrough the interdependence of prices and their natural tendency towards\\nequalizing in various economies. In the next part of the paper, the\\nauthor analyzes the conditions in which the Czechoslovak economy is\\nsituated during the period of transformation to a market economy. The\\nauthor comes to a conclusion that in this period - when many structural\\nchanges necessarily occur - the theory of PPP cannot be applied to the\\ndetermination of the rate of exchange.\\nThere are other reasons arguing against the application of the theory.\\nThe first reason is that the ratio of domestic and foreign prices is a\\nratio of domestic prices formed through nonmarket processes and foreign\\nprices determined in market economies. As a result of the former\\nlong-term independence between domestic and foreign prices, the overall\\nlevels of domestic and foreign prices have not moved in a parallel way.\\nBut it is just the parallelism of the price movements which is an\\nimportant assumption of the validity and consequently of the\\napplicability of the theory of PPP.\\nThe author also attempts to prove that for determination of the exchange\\nrate between the CSK and freely convertible currencies - in connection\\nwith introducing its partial, i. e., internal convertibility - it is not\\nsuitable to use the rate of exchange of the CSK on the black market or\\nits rates formed abroad. There is one remaining possibility (the one\\ncurrently in use): to determine the level of the rate of exchange in\\nsuch a way that makes the initial rate on the established inter-bank\\nhard currency market more or less balanced.\\nIn the last part of the study the problems connected with this solution\\nare discussed. The primary problem is the considerable deviation of the\\nrate of exchange from the rate of purchasing power parity. The author\\nidentifies those factors that cause the size of this deviation and are\\nsymptomatic of economies that formerly were centrally planned. He\\nexplains the assertion that the distance of the realistic rate of\\nexchange from the PPP is irrelevant for expressing comparative\\nadvantages and disadvantages. On the contrary, only the rate of exchange\\nreflecting the ratio of the actual supply of and demand for convertible\\ncurrencies does not distort the expressing of comparative advantages.\\nThe author critically evaluates the procedure chosen for determination\\nof the exchange rate of the CSK before introducing its internal\\nconvertibility. He refers to the consequences of the deviation of the\\nexchange rate from PPP, particularly in relation to wage level\\ndevelopment, and outlines a proposal for reducing this deviation.", "identifiers": {"issn": "0032-3233"}, "source": "POLITICKA EKONOMIE", "authors": [{"first_name": "A", "last_name": "NEUSTADT"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/purchasing-power-parity-transforming-czechoslovak-economy", "year": 1992, "type": "journal", "id": "b85a8de4-c3fc-3ffd-a751-916f65c31ae8"}, {"title": "The purchasing power parity puzzle", "abstract": "Discusses the concept of purchasing power parity.

Rives (henceforth R.), author and co-editor of several volumes on religion in the Roman world.2 In line with the scope of the series, which aims at offering modern readers introductions to religion in the ancient world, this book presents itself as an agile and stimulating overview of religious phenomenology in the Roman empire, accessible also to those with little or no previous exposure to Classical Studies. In order to clarify the scope and the method of his work, in the \"Introduction\" R. begins with a comment on the terms contained in the book title, offering first a basic chronological and geographical definition of the Roman Empire. Religion used in the singular in opposition to the more common plural best connotes the author's original approach. According to R., the variety of religious phenomena within the Roman Empire is in fact better understood if treated as the multifaceted expressions of a single sensibility rather than by creating artificial divisions not corresponding to the ancient mentality. Considering the lack of sacred scriptures, religion in the Greco-Roman world has to be studied through other types of evidence (literature, inscriptions) and the last part of the introduction is dedicated to presenting such sources, illustrating their nature as well as their limits. Chapter One, \"Identifying Religion in the Greco-Roman World\", opens with a discussion of the vocabulary in use in the Greek and Roman world to express religious practices and belief. Offering a brief survey of the linguistic uses of both cultures, the author draws attention to the lack in the Greco-Roman world of a specific term exactly corresponding to \"religion\" in the modern sense of the word. This lack betrays an approach to this important sphere of human activity very far removed from the one made popular by the advent of monotheistic religions. Once the impossibility of an exact linguistic superimpositione has been verified, R.'s attempt to offer a definition of religion in the Greco-Roman world continues by analysing the varied conceptions of the divine, the way these related to and interacted with divinities (cult, myth, art, philosophy) and finally what role important issues such as authority, belief and morality played in directing people's attitude and beliefs. Chapter Two, \"Regional Religious Traditions of the Empire\", contains a quick survey of the religious practices in the various areas of the Roman Empire (Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, North Africa, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Italy). For each of them the author first briefly presents the historical events which led them into the Romans' sphere of influence and then describes the peculiarities of local divinities and their cult. A summarizing paragraph reflects on the dynamic tensions between uniformity and diversity, particularization and generalization, continuity and change which were so important in shaping the religious phenomenon in the Greco-Roman world. Chapter Three, \"The Presence of the Gods\", explores the way ancient people experienced the divine, concentrating on three specific aspects. The first paragraph is dedicated to exploring the trend of identifying the divine in the natural world to the extent that certain places were considered either as divinities or as dwellings of a deity. A second feature common to the Greco-Roman tradition is the acknowledgement of superhuman power in direct relation with the gods' deeds and the benefits they were able to grant to their followers. Tightly intertwined with the latter is the manifestation of the gods in people's everyday lives, and the third paragraph offers an overview of the modalities of these encounters as reflected in literary texts and inscriptions. A partial corrective to the emphasis on the personal encounter with the divine of the previous chapter, Chapter Four, \"Religion and Community\", aptly serves as a reminder of the social and political dimension of the religious experience in the Greco-Roman world. Largely building on passages from Aristotle's Politics, R. identifies the city, the household and voluntary associations as aggregating poles for the performance of cultic activity as well as for the shaping of religious identity. In spite of the important role played by cult and belief on a local level, religion greatly contributed to promoting integration and a sense of belonging among citizens of the Roman Empire. Chapter Five, \"Religion and Empire\", concentrates on four different phenomena that served this purpose, the first of which was the exchange of ideas and beliefs favoured by travels and pilgrimages to consult oracles, attend religious festivals and visit famous sanctuaries and temples. A similar and probably even more pervasive effect was obtained through the relocation and the immigration of people such as slaves, traders, and soldiers from one region of the empire to the other. Identification processes such as the interpretatio romana syncretism (the latter, in the view of the author, is reserved only to processes involving more complex philosophical and religious elaborations) are considered some of the most effective strategies used to create a certain degree of religious unity in the variegated panorama of the Roman empire. A similar role is then acknowledged for the imperial cult in all its nuanced and locally differentiated manifestations. Chapter Six, \"Religious Options\", explores all those religious alternatives, including esoteric wisdom, miracle working and mystery cults, which distanced themselves from mainstream practices and belief. Rather than offering a list of these options, the author chooses to articulate his analysis from two perspectives, namely the attractions they exerted on their followers and the advantages they offered. Chapter Seven, \"Roman Religious Policy\", deals with the issue of Roman authority and examines the extent to which it intervened and influenced religious matters both by condemning improper behaviour such as atheism and superstition and by imposing specific obligations on the other. After some general considerations, three specific study cases including magic, Judaic tradition and Christianity are scrutinized. The \"Epilogue: Religious Change in the Roman Empire\", offers a partial counterbalance to the lack of a diachronic approach in the rest of the book. It underlines the importance of keeping development and evolution in mind when considering religion in the Roman Empire, offering brief considerations on the development of phenomena such as the imperial cult, the spread of the so-called mystery religions and Christianity. A list of further reading, mostly restricted to bibliography written in or translated into English, is offered at the end of each chapter. A stimulating tool is represented by the six boxes of text which allow a close encounter with primary sources of literary and epigraphic nature. The need to limit both the size and the cost of the book notwithstanding, a slight increase in their number would have significantly expanded the didactic possibilities of this text. The volume is aptly complemented by two practical glossaries offering essential information on the major deities and the authors and texts cited in the text, as well as by bibliographical references and a general index. Four maps inserted at the beginning of the volume, illustrating the Roman Empire in the second century CE, Greece and Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, North Africa and Western Europe, offer a useful if basic cartographic support which enables a fast identification of areas and centres mentioned in the text. Eleven black and white pictures illustrate selected objects and monuments among those dealt with in the various chapters. If R.'s decision to emphasize the unity and the homogeneity of the religious phenomenology in the Roman world (symbolized by his preference for the singular religion vs. the plural religions) is innovative and potentially fruitful, it also contains some risks. Whereas the book title leads the reader to expect a treatment of Roman religion in the imperial period,3 the author's decision to favour a synchronic rather than a diachronic approach and his too often recurring identification of the imperial Roman religious practices and belief with main stream Greco-Roman tradition lead to a considerable historical and chronological flattening. In Chapter Two the regional traditions of the Empire and their toleration and support by imperial authorities are explained by calling into question the \"Greco-Roman elite\" who \"considered it normal for every people to have their own deities and religious tradition\" (54). The tendency to recognize the presence of the gods in natural phenomena is illustrated by quoting and treating on the same level passages of Hesiod, Seneca and Apuleius, leading only to the correct but also banal conclusion that \"water was also very important in the Greco-Roman tradition, as indicated by the high profile of springs and rivers in both myth and cult\" or that caves and rocks played an important role in various regions of the Mediterranean (91). In Chapter Four, the tight connections existing between religion and the civic community are sketched out through examples mostly derived from the Greek world, such as the cult of Artemis in Ephesus or Athena's worship in Athens (115-117), while the relationships within the household, another important seat of religious activity, is outlined on the basis of Aristotle's witness (117). The interference of political authorities in regulating domestic cult is illustrated by appealing to Aristotle and Cicero, but neither author, in spite of their value in other respects, qualifies as a witness for Roman imperial practice (121).

This model, according to Christopher Fuhrmann, fails to properly account for the imperial-era evidence, which argues in fact for an expansion of state-sponsored policing activities in the first three centuries of the Common Era. Drawing on a wide variety of source material--from art, archaeology, administrative documents, Egyptian papyri, laws, Jewish and Christian religious texts, and ancient narratives--Policing the Roman Empire provides a comprehensive overview of Roman imperial policing practices with chapters devoted to fugitive slave hunting, the pivotal role of Augustus, the expansion of policing under his successors, and communities lacking soldier-police that were forced to rely on self-help or civilian police. Rather than merely cataloguing references to police, this study sets policing in the broader context of Roman attitudes towards power, public order, and administration. Fuhrmann argues that a broad range of groups understood the potential value of police, from the emperors to the peasantry. Years of different police initiatives coalesced into an uneven patchwork of police institutions that were not always coordinated, effective, or upright.

This deity, termed 'Brahm??', was conceived as being 'the all-seeing, the all-powerful, the Lord, the maker and creator, ruler, appointer and orderer, father of all that have been and will be'. Although the Buddha completely rejected such apparent metaphysical speculation as a 'thicket of views', he nowhere formulated a systematic repudiation of theism. In one canonical text, however, the Buddha, encountering a young Brahmin espousing theistic beliefs, gives a series of analogies and similes that help to illuminate his views on the matter. In short, the Buddha saw such a belief as being dangerously reflexive, and hence as a symptom of a debilitating conceptual and affective disorder. Thus, in the dialogue, the Buddha aims to ease this ailment of his interlocutor through a threefold strategy: (1) displaying the language usage that under girds the problem; (2) reorienting the interlocutor towards the primacy of his conceptual apparatus as the proper locus of concern; and (3) providing a practice through which the interlocutor may develop the skills necessary for conceptual and affective health. The parameters of the discussion in this sutta are wide enough to render it of relevance to contemporary debates on theism. That is, the issue at stake in the sutta may be read as being not only about a restricted local notion of deity, but about God, broadly conceived.

Each monotheistic religion has its characteristic ways of domesticating True Divinity, of taming God's demands so that they do not radically threaten our self-love and false righteousness. Turning the monotheistic critique of idolatry on the monotheisms themselves, Johnston shows that much in these traditions must be condemned as false and spiritually debilitating. A central claim of the book is that supernaturalism is idolatry. If this is right, everything changes; we cannot place our salvation in jeopardy by tying it essentially to the supernatural cosmologies of the ancient Near East. Remarkably, Johnston rehabilitates the ideas of the Fall and of salvation within a naturalistic framework; he then presents a conception of God that both resists idolatry and is wholly consistent with the deliverances of the natural sciences.

Going beyond the traditional focus on Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli, it emphasizes the diversity of the \"sacramentarian\" challenge to traditional belief in Christ's corporeal presence in the bread and wine of the Eucharist, and it re-evaluates the significance of Luther's colleague, Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt, for the debate.

Ultimately, Burnett shows how Karlstadt's eucharistic pamphlets introduced into the public debate arguments that would become standard Reformed criticisms of the Lutheran position. The book also demonstrates the influence not only of Erasmus but also of John Wyclif and the Hussites for discussions of the sacrament, highlights the role of the reformers of Basel and Strasbourg for developing the \"Zwinglian\" understanding of the Lord's Supper, and draws attention to the early eucharistic theology of the Silesians Kaspar Schwenckfeld and Valentin Krautwald.

Angelo Corlett The Errors of Atheism J. Angelo Corlett, The Errors of Atheism, Continuum, 2010, 248pp., 29.95 (pbk), ISBN 9781441158932. Reviewed by Bradley Monton, University of Colorado at Boulder and Rebecca Chan, University of Colorado at Boulder J. Angelo Corlett's The Errors of Atheism is a compelling, nuanced look at why agnosticism may be a more tenable position than atheism. Corlett takes for granted that there exist successful refutations of orthodox Christian theism -- in fact, he maintains that the Christian brand of theism is not worthy of the amount of philosophical attention it has received. But he holds that, because atheists focus so much on this \"highly problematic\" traditional notion of the nature of God, what the atheists are actually doing is refuting \"a straw person notion of the nature of God\" (p. 92). Because standard atheistic arguments are not applicable to unorthodox theisms, Corlett says, atheists err in claiming victory over theism. Corlett puts on the table a theism that purportedly survives standard atheistic arguments: \"hybrid minimalist process-liberationist theology\". But Corlett does not definitively endorse this theology: he holds that there are no strong arguments for (or against) it and hence thinks that one should remain agnostic between atheism and the truth of this theology. He calls this position the \"New Agnosticism\". In outline, the discussion of the book runs as follows. Chapter 1 defines theism, atheism, and agnosticism, and draws distinctions between weak and strong as well as epistemic and ontological variations of these three positions. Chapter 2 discusses various errors of atheism and lays out multiple fallacies commonly committed by atheists. Chapter 3 looks at Dawkins's specific brand of atheism and concludes the negative argument Corlett puts forth against atheism. Chapter 4 sets the initial stage for the positive portion of Corlett's argument by listing six desiderata for a New Agnosticism that is resistant to atheism. Chapters 5 and 6 present two aspects of a hybrid, minimalist theism that Corlett believes withstands atheistic attacks. These two chapters draw their essential features from, respectively, process theology and liberation theology. Chapter 7 anticipates and addresses potential objections to the hybrid minimalist theism. Corlett concludes by discussing the significance of his position in the dialogue between atheism and theism, maintaining that his New Agnosticism forces atheists and theists to consider less extreme, and more plausible, positions with respect to the question of the existence of God. So what are the errors of atheism that the title of Corlett's book refers to? While Corlett presents various fallacies that atheists ostensibly fall prey to, they boil down to two main errors. First, he says that atheists commit the fallacy of equivocation between atheism and agnosticism. Corlett holds that atheists sometimes define atheism in probabilistic terms, but they are wrong to do so. In fact, according to Corlett, anyone who claims that it is improbable -- even highly improbable -- that God exists is an agnostic. Corlett says that prominent, self-proclaimed atheists commit this error and misidentify themselves as atheists when they are really agnostics. The second main error that atheists ostensibly commit is that they treat orthodox Christianity as their most worthy, or sole, opponent. Defeat of orthodox Christianity is then treated as defeat of theism, which Corlett claims is an unwarranted conclusion due to the existence of more plausible, unorthodox theisms. Regarding the difference between atheism and agnosticism, one might think that this is just a matter of terminology and hence not worthy of any sort of extended philosophical discussion. In fact, this is what we are inclined to think. But Corlett takes the distinction seriously. \"Epistemological atheism\" is defined by Corlett as the position that \"one knows that it is not the case that God exists (weak version), or one knows that it is not the case that God's existence is even possible or that God can exist (strong version)\" (p. 33). And \"ontological atheism\" is defined as the position that \"it is not the case that God exists\" (weak version) or \"it is not the case that God's existence is even possible\" (strong version). Corlett contrasts this with, for example, the position of a \"positive ontological agnostic\", who holds that \"it is probable that God exists\", and a \"negative ontological agnostic\", who holds that \"it is probable that it is not the case that God exists\" (p. 32). This sort of presentation makes it sound as if one has to be subjectively certain that God doesn't exist to consider oneself an atheist. Indeed, in contrasting ontological agnosticism with ontological atheism, Corlett says that \"The ontological agnostic claims that there is insufficient reason to affirm or deny with certitude (at least for the time being and lacking further evidence) either theism or atheism\" (p. 32, our emphasis). We think that Corlett is setting an unreasonable standard for atheism (and, by parity, theism) if \"knowing that it is not the case that God exists\" involves absolute certainty in one's subjective degree of belief. This requires an atheist to be as certain about the non-existence of God as she is that 2+2=4. While there probably are some atheists who are like that, it seems reasonable to count people as atheists without requiring them to be so dogmatic. Interestingly, while in Chapter 1 Corlett spends a lot of time justifying his extreme non-probabilistic characterization of atheism, in a footnote in Chapter 2 he presents a more moderate view. First, in the main body of the text he writes: \"just as the responsible theist will be a fallibilist, so will the thoughtful atheist\". Then, in the footnote attached to that sentence, he goes on to say: One way in which atheism expresses its fallibilism is by stating the denial of God's existence in probabilistic terms, just as the theist might express the existence of God inductively. In this way, there is a certain agnostic tempering of theism and atheism, respectively. Only their infallibilist cousins seem to be quite different from agnosticism. (p. 60) This sounds right to us, though it does raise the question of how to draw the line between fallibilist atheism and agnosticism. A reasonable position to take is that the distinction is in fact blurred and cannot be articulated non-arbitrarily, but that the distinction does exist. Those who assign a probability of 0 to the hypothesis that God exists are clearly atheists, and those who assign a probability of 0.5 are clearly agnostic, but whether those who assign a probability of, say, 0.25 are atheists or agnostics might be unclear. Perhaps a more fine-grained approach that takes degrees of belief into account is more appropriate than attempting to classify people as strictly atheistic or agnostic. (For some more arguably insightful thoughts on degrees-of-belief-based analyses of agnosticism, see Monton 1998, H{\u00e1}jek 1998, and van Fraassen 1998.) Let's now turn to the second main error of atheism. Corlett holds that atheists myopically focus on orthodox Christianity and unfairly treat a defeat of that view as a defeat of theism. Corlett says that this is unwarranted because hybrid minimalist process-liberationist theology is more plausible than orthodox Christianity. We agree with Corlett here, to an extent. The philosophy of religion literature that contemporary Western English-speaking atheist philosophers tend to focus on is largely produced by contemporary Western English-speaking philosophers of religion, the majority of whom are Christians. It would be better if variant versions of theism were discussed more often in the contemporary Western English-speaking philosophy of religion debates. Unfortunately, Corlett does a better job making the general point -- that atheists are too often focused on philosophers who endorse orthodox Christianity -- than he does getting into the details and pointing out specific errors that specific atheist philosophers have made. There is a section discussing Richard Dawkins, but atheist philosophers could reasonably maintain that Corlett's focusing on Dawkins is straw-personing atheism. Moreover, even after reading Corlett we are not convinced that there is a widespread problem in the arguments of atheists here. At least some of the arguments that orthodox Christian philosophers give are actually arguments for theism more generally, without the requirements that the God being argued for is even omnipotent or omniscient (traits that God lacks according to Corlett's preferred version of theism). Consider for example William Lane Craig's (1979) version of the kalam cosmological argument, or Robin Collins' (2002) version of the fine-tuning argument, or J.P. Moreland's (2008) version of the argument from consciousness. In each of these cases we have Christian philosophers arguing for the existence of God, but they're not arguing distinctively for the existence of the Christian God, or even for a God who is omnipotent and omniscient. Part of the way Corlett makes the point that atheists focus too much on orthodox Christianity is by presenting an unorthodox theism that purportedly withstands the atheistic critiques to which orthodox theisms are vulnerable. Corlett maintains that his preferred version of unorthodox theism, hybrid minimalist process-liberationist theism, is not convincing enough to generate theistic belief, but it is a theism that, according to Corlett, is untouched by extant atheist arguments. Thus he maintains that the best position to take is one of agnosticism. Corlett presents his preferred theistic view by first, in Chapter 5, presenting an intriguing account of process theology and then, in Chapter 6, talking about liberation theology.

The legitimate way to stir up a storm in any scientific discipline is to come up with an alternative theory that (1) makes a prediction that is crisply denied by the reigning theory but turns out to be true or (2) explains something that has been baffling defenders of the status quo or (3) unifies two distant theories, at the cost of some element of the currently accepted view. To date, the proponents of intelligent design (ID) have not produced a single instance of anything like that. There are no experiments with results that challenge any standard neo-Darwinian understanding, no observations from the fossil record or genomics or biogeography or comparative anatomy that undermine standard evolutionary thinking, no theoretical unifications or simplifications, and no surprising predictions that have turned out to be true. In short, no science--just advertising. No ID hypothesis has even been ventured as a rival explanation of any biological phenomenon. To formulate a competing hypothesis, you have to get down in the trenches and offer some details that have testable implications, but the ID proponents conveniently sidestep that requirement, claiming that they have no specifics in mind about who or what the intelligent designer might be.

How It Works/Example: Typical asset classes include stocks, bonds, real estate, cash and commodities. These groups can also be broken down further. For example, the asset class \"stocks\" can be broken down either by industry -- e.g., manufacturing, automotive or energy -- or by a more general characteristic of the investment -- e.g., value, growth or blue chip. Why It Matters: When diversifying a portfolio, it is crucial to have investments spread across different asset classes. Since investments belonging to the same asset class are expected to have correlated changes in value, having investments in only one asset class is proverbially putting all of your eggs in one basket. By diversifying across asset classes, volatility within your portfolio (e.g. risk) will decrease. A portfolio manager will often have a prescribed allocation of investments across different asset classes based on the investor's risk preference, and then only have to choose which stocks to buy in a particular class. It is often most important to look at the general characteristics of an investment and how it fits into the overall market rather than minute details of a stock. Generally speaking, a conservative portfolio will have a higher percentage of cash and risk-free bonds, while a portfolio aiming for a higher return will have more stocks and risky bonds.

The Memorialization of the Weimar Republic and the Politics of History of the Federal Republic of Germany", "abstract": "\u2018Are we living under Weimar conditions, Mister Chancellor?\u2019 ran the headline printed by the German weekly Welt am Sonntag early in 2005 above a long interview with Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.1 Statistics had just shown a rise in unemployment rates to over 5 million people and right-wing extremism appeared to be steadily gaining support. The comparison of today\u2019s Federal Republic of Germany with the first German democracy of 1918 may seem strange at first sight. However, upon looking into recent political debates, it becomes clear that the Weimar Republic is used quite often as a reference point for comments on current developments in Germany. This presence of the Weimar Republic shows that, for the Federal Republic, the first German democracy is \u2014 and has been ever since 1945 \u2014 more then merely a bygone historical era. The Weimar past hung over the Republic\u2019s beginnings like a very long shadow. The famous phrase \u2018Bonn is not Weimar\u2019 (\u2018Bonn ist nicht Weimar\u2019), coined by the Swiss journalist Fritz Ren\u00e9 Allemann as a title for his study of the Bonn Republic, was only beginning to gain acceptance as a legitimate depiction when the book was first published in 1956. Contrary to the GDR, where official propaganda left no doubt that \u2018lessons from Weimar\u2019 had been learned through the \u2018antifascist-democratic\u2019 revolution after 1945, the Federal Republic was never certain of its \u2018otherness\u2019 in relationship to Weimar \u2013 even though the urge to learn from the failure of the first German democracy had played an important role in the democratic reconstruction after the collapse of National Socialism.2 Memorialization in Germany since 1945 Memorialization in Germany since 1945 Look Inside Reference tools Export citation Add to Papers Other actions About this Book Reprints and Permissions Share Share this content on Facebook Share this content on Twitter Share this content on LinkedIn", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84906322541", "doi": "10.1057/9780230248502_36", "isbn": "978-1-349-30254-3"}, "source": "Memorialization in Germany since 1945 SE - 36", "authors": [{"first_name": "Sebastian", "last_name": "Ullrich"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/democratic-legacy-memorialization-weimar-republic-politics-history-federal-republic-germany", "year": 2010, "type": "book_section", "id": "ccb2cc70-709f-381d-a4e7-20518da1e061"}, {"title": "Judgment, 23 September 1987.", "abstract": "The Court held that a private insurance company must pay for the second and third attempts at in-vitro fertilization made by an insured couple.

In spite of this fact, the role of family as related to different historical changes is rarely investigated. The research concept of the study is based on the \"theory of transition\" (early sports socialization) and on the principle of \"generation transfer\" (parent-child interaction) within various micro (family) and macro (socio-economic) contexts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the presented study is to find out the relationship between family context and early sports socialization in families of national football team players in the Czech Republic in three different socio-economic periods. METHODS: Three generations of national football team players were investigated. The research sample P (n = 69) was made up of subsamples - P1 (n = 23) - the current generation of national football team players from the year 1991, P2 (n = 23) - the generation playing in the years 1981-2001 and P3 n = 23) - the generation playing in the years 1965-1987. Data were gained by means of semistructured interview oriented to family background in the period of the players' early sports socialization. Responses were analysed and classified on a categorical scale (5 domains per 4 categories), then processed using descriptive statistics. Comparisons of selected categories were processed using the non-parametric chi-square test at a significance level of p < 0.05. RESULTS: The equal role of fathers' was found in all three generations in equal categories (type of education, involvement in football, the motivation approach). The role of mothers became different related to the progress in women's emancipation, but was supportive for sports career development of the children. CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasized the importance of early sports socialization in the family, the importance of generation transfer, the function of the father, mother and siblings as motivators, regardless of participat ion in any of the three different generations.

A profile of a National Football League team. J Strength Cond Res 28(1): 7-13, 2014-The purpose of this study was to document the physical profiles of players on the 2011 New York Giants (NYG) team and to make comparisons with the historical literature on previous National Football League (NFL) player profiles. In this study, height, body mass (BM), body fat percentage (BF%) using skinfold measurements, and several predicted 1 repetition maximal strength and power measures in 30 returning players from the 2011 NYG team, who recently won the Super Bowl, were collected. Players were grouped by position: running back, quarterback (QB), wide receiver (WR), tight end, offensive lineman (OL), defensive lineman (DL), linebacker (LB), and defensive back (DB). Pooled and weighted mean differences (NYG - NFL) and effect sizes were used to evaluate height, BM, and BF% comparisons of NYG to previous NFL studies from 1998 to 2009. The characteristics of the players as a group were: age, height, BM, BF%: 26 \u00b1 2 years, 183.8 \u00b1 9.0 cm, 144.9 \u00b1 20.8 kg, 14.3 \u00b1 5.5%, respectively. Comparisons highlight distinct position-specific dissimilarity in strength measures, BM, and BF%, which reflect current strength training, conditioning, and team play strategy. As expected, NYG positional differences were found for height (p \u2264 0.05), BM (p \u2264 0.037), BF% (p \u2264 0.048), bench press (p \u2264 0.048), inclined bench press (p \u2264 0.013), and squat (p \u2264 0.026).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Classification of declared food supplements according to the active ingredient and medications according to therapeutic actions and active compounds. RESULTS: 24.3% of the athletes tested for doping control declared no use of medications or food supplements. Food supplements (45.3%) continue to be popular, with vitamins (43.2%) and proteins/aminoacids (13.9%) in power sports being most widely used. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and analgesics were also commonly used by athletes (11.1% and 3.7%, respectively). The use of the hemoderivative actovegin and several nonprohibited anabolic preparations are discussed. The prevalence of medication use for asthma and the dangers of drug interactions are also presented.Laboratory analysis data reveal that of the aTUEs received for inhaled glucocorticosteroids, only budesonide was detectable in significant percentage (10.0%).

Mancuso, a scientist who found himself at odds with the US government over his studies regarding the radiation hazards of nuclear weapons production. Although high-ranking officials were aware of potentially serious health risks to workers and were urged by its advisors to conduct health studies, the Atomic Energy Commission did not initiate occupational epidemiological research until 1964. That year. Dr. Thomas F. Mancuso, Professor of Occupational Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, was approached by staff of the AEC's Division of Biology and Medicine to undertake a feasibility study. According to Mancuso, the AEC staff asked him if there were sufficient data to \"answer a basic question, that is, whether there were or were not any effects of low-level ionizing radiation\". Based on a review of records at 14 AEC facilities, Mancuso concluded it was possible, and was awarded a five-year research contract in 1965. By that time, Mancuso had established himself as a highly respected figure in the field of occupational epidemiology. While serving as chief of the Ohio Division of Industrial Hygiene between 1945 and 1962, Mancuso published a series of ground-breaking studies showing the toxicological and carcinogenic effects of cadmium, manganese, mercury, hydrogen sulfide, asbestos, aromatic amines, and chromate. With the encouragement of his mentor, Wilhehn Huper, at the National Cancer Institute, Mancuso designed and published the first cohort mortality studies on occupational cohorts in the United States. In doing so Mancuso invented a revolutionary methodology using Social Security death benefit claims that enabled researchers for the first time to follow exposed workers over the many years necessary to detect latent diseases such as cancer. In 1961, he had been given a career award by the National Cancer Institute for his impressive body of work. Mancuso was also known for his honesty and fierce independence. In the 1950s, Phillip Carey Corp., a manufacturer of asbestos insulation hired Mancuso with the expectation that he would provide evidence refuting compensation claims by workers dying from respiratory diseases following exposure to asbestos. Instead, Mancuso's research supported the worker's claims. He strongly advised the company that it had a responsibility to inform the workers of potential risks. Because Phillip Carey ignored Mancuso's warning throughout the 1960s, his research was subsequently used by claimants. What motivated the AEC officials to approach Mancuso? A key factor was that the national security imperative to exercise control over radiation heath effects research was loosening as Cold War tensions reduced. Moreover, the AEC suffered a serious blow to its credibility in 1963, when the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union ratified the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which prohibited atmospheric nuclear weapons tests.

This book examines the fate of this vast nuclear weapon complex and the unprecedented non-proliferation challenges associated with the breakup of a nuclear weapon state. It describes the high-level diplo- matic bargaining efforts to consolidate in Russia the nuclear weapons based in newly independent Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine and to strengthen central control over these weapons. It surveys the problems associated with dismantling nuclear weapons and the difficulties involved in safely storing and disposing of large stockpiles of fissile material. It reviews the key provisions of the principal nuclear arms control measures and initiatives, including the START I and START II treaties. Finally, the book assesses the contribution of international assistance programmes to the denuclearization process underway in the former Soviet Union. Highlights and key conclusions of the book The nuclear disarmament process in the former Soviet Union is taking place in a political and social framework that is far from stable. The process of change in the former Soviet Union has not yet reached its turning-point: the economic and political outlook remains clouded and tensions are high both within the republics of the former Soviet Union and between them. The nuclear disarmament process in the former Soviet Union must be accelerated. The nuclear disarmament process must be speeded up: even the nearest START II deadline, the year 2000, looks far in the future in the light of the current political volatility in the former Soviet Union. Assisting with the speeding up of the nuclear disarmament process is well within the technological and economic capabilities of the industrialized world. The pressing questions concerning the final disposition of fissile material, particularly plutonium, extracted from nuclear weapons must be resolved. The denuclearization assistance provided by the USA and other countries to the former Soviet Union represents only a tiny fraction of their annual defence outlays. Although it is impracticable to attach a monetary value to the security obtained through various assistance programmes, the findings in this research report indicate that the security benefit received through these disbursements far exceeds the cost. Financial assistance to Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union must be significantly increased in order to: build more secure storage sites for nuclear weapons and fissile materials; raise the level of security at existing sites via, among other measures, the rapid adoption of more sophisticated methods for material control and accountancy; improve export and border controls; improve the living conditions of nuclear custodians, technicians and scientists; and double or triple the rate of dismantlement of nuclear warheads. A division of labour between wealthy non-nuclear weapon and nuclear weapon states could be envisaged whereby: wealthy non-nuclear weapon states could concentrate their efforts outside the sensitive areas of warhead dismantlement and fissile material; and France, the UK and the USA could concentrate on the sensitive areas of warhead dismantlement and fissile material. The European Union, as a whole, and its non-nuclear weapon state members in particular, are well-suited to provide crucial assistance in a range of areas: environmental recovery and restoration (the cleanup of nuclear and chemical waste); provision of Science and Technology Centres and other research opportunities for former nuclear weapon scientists; the establishment of effective export controls (from assistance in drafting regulations and laws to the training of personnel); conversion of industry from military to civilian purposes; and programmes and techniques of energy conservation. No effort should be spared to make the fissile materials extracted from nuclear warheads as impervious as possible to recycling into the manufacture of new explosive devices. One of the various options available for plutonium disposition should be quickly agreed and implemented as soon as possible. To prevent illicit use in bombs, stocks of highly enriched uranium should be blended down to lower enrichment immediately. A verified global inventory of nuclear warheads and fissile material should be established as soon as possible. Contents 1. Introduction 2. Consolidating the nuclear arsenal - I.

The NSC further developed its work in this area in 2005 through the formation of an expert group whose designated task was the preparation of a report on Research and Test Facilities Required in Nuclear Science and Technology. The expert group met in May and December 2005, May and October 2006 and April 2007. At these meetings, participants reviewed existing activities within the NEA as they related to the task of the group, as well as on similar activities in other organisations. Following the initial expert group meeting, a database listing all relevant facilities was prepared using information from the earlier NSC report, from members of the expert group and other scientists in their countries, from relevant databases and from other reports such as the NEA report on Support Facilities for Existing and Advanced Reactors (SFEAR). The database was released for public access via the NEA website in February 2008 at www.nea.fr/rtfdb/. Based on information collected for the database and on input from expert group members and a small number of external contacts, this report identifies the current portfolio of facilities (of an international dimension) that exist in NEA member countries and relates them to the R&D needs within the scope of the NSC. In addition, and as a particular focus of the expert groups activity, the report has sought to identify the research facilities required to satisfy future needs.", "identifiers": {"isbn": "9789264990708"}, "source": "Science And Technology", "authors": [{"first_name": "Nuclear", "last_name": "Energy"}, {"first_name": "Agency", "last_name": "Organisation"}, {"first_name": "Economic", "last_name": "Co-operation"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/research-test-facilities-required-nuclear-science-technology", "year": 2009, "type": "journal", "id": "1b953da7-40aa-353b-aca0-2761e30c17a6"}, {"title": "Nuclear Power Proliferation Resistance : Securing Benefits , Limiting Risk", "abstract": "Global electricity demand is expected to increase by more than 50 percent by 2025 and nuclear power is a primary carbon-free energy source for meeting this extensive global energy expansion.

Little detailed open-source information is available about the DPRK's nuclear weapons production capabilities, warhead sophistication, the scope and success of its uranium enrichment program, or extent of its proliferation activities. In total, it is estimated that North Korea has between 30 and 50 kilograms of separated plutonium, enough for at least half a dozen nuclear weapons. While North Korea's weapons program has been plutonium-based from the start, in the last decade, intelligence emerged pointing to a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium. North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, but has said its purpose is the production of fuel for nuclear power. In November 2010, North Korea showed visiting American experts early construction of a 100 MWT light-water reactor and a newly built gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant, both at the Yongbyon site. The North Koreans claimed the enrichment plant was operational, but this has not been independently confirmed. U.S. officials have said that it is likely other, clandestine enrichment facilities exist.Beginning in late 2002, North Korea ended an eight-year freeze on its plutonium production program, expelled international inspectors, and restarted facilities. In September 2005, members of the Six-Party Talks (United States, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and North Korea) issued a Joint Statement on the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On October 9, 2006, North Korea conducted a nuclear test, with a yield of less than 1 kiloton. In February 2007, North Korea and the other members of the Six-Party Talks agreed on steps for phased implementation of the 2005 denuclearization agreement. Phase 1 included the shut-down of plutonium production at the Yongbyon nuclear complex in exchange for an initial heavy fuel oil shipment to North Korea. Phase 2 steps included disablement of plutonium production facilities at Yongbyon and a \"complete and correct\" declaration of DPRK nuclear activities, in exchange for delivery of energy assistance and removal of certain U.S. sanctions. The declaration was submitted in June 2008. Thereafter, President Bush removed North Korea from the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) list and notified Congress of his intent to lift the State Sponsor of Terrorism (SST) designation after North Korea agreed to verification provisions. North Korea did not accept initial U.S. verification proposals, and in September 2008, threatened to restart reprocessing plutonium. U.S. officials announced a verbal bilateral agreement on verification in October 2008, and the Bush administration removed North Korea from the SST List. North Korea soon after said that it had not agreed to sampling at nuclear sites, a key element for verification of plutonium production. The Six-Party Talks have not convened since December 2008. North Korea's failed satellite launch on April 5, 2009, which used ballistic missile-related technology, led to U.N. Security Council condemnation. In response, North Korea said it would abandon the Six-Party Talks and restart its nuclear facilities, and asked international and U.S. inspectors to leave the country. North Korea claimed it tested a nuclear weapon on May 25, 2009, which is estimated as larger than the 2006 blast, but still modest. Through its official news agency, North Korea claimed in September 2009 that it was conducting \"experimental uranium enrichment\" and in November 2009 that it had reprocessed spent fuel at the Yongbyon facility and had begun to weaponize the resulting plutonium. Some view the revelations of a uranium enrichment plant and light-water reactor plans in November 2010 as part of a provocative North Korean strategy to draw other states back to the bargaining table, while others view the facilities as evidence that North Korea is determined to advance its nuclear program despite international sanctions. In late 2010, North Korea reportedly offered to allow international nuclear inspectors back into the country and discussed shipping out its stockpile of 12,000 fresh fuel rods. \u00a9 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

U.S. officials have said that it is likely other, clandestine enrichment facilities exist. A February 2012 announcement committed North Korea to moratoria on nuclear and long-range missile testing as well as uranium enrichment suspension at Yongbyon under IAEA monitoring. However, an April 2012 satellite launch, which violated UN Security Council resolutions, caused a collapse of the February agreement. A December 2012 satellite launch was met with UN Security Council condemnation. North Korea has also made policy statements asserting its nuclear weapons status: in May 2012, North Korea changed its constitution to say that it was a \"nuclear-armed state.\" In January 2013, North Korea said that no dialogue on denuclearization \"would be possible\" and it would only disarm when all the other nuclear weapon states also disarm. Many experts believe that the prime objective of North Korea's nuclear program is to develop a nuclear warhead that could be mounted on North Korea's intermediate-range and long-range missiles. Miniaturization of a nuclear warhead would likely require additional nuclear and missile tests. In January 2013, a North Korean statement said that it would respond with a nuclear test \"of higher level.\" On February 12, 2013, the North Korean official news agency announced a \"successful\" underground nuclear detonation, and seismic monitoring systems measured a resulting earthquake that was 5.1 in magnitude. This is magnitude is slightly higher than past tests, but yield estimates are still uncertain. The South Korean Ministry of Defense estimated that the test yield was between 6 and 7 kilotons, while the U.S. Director of National Intelligence so far has said \"approximately several kilotons.\" North Korea claimed that the February 12, 2013, nuclear test was to develop a \"smaller and light\" warhead. At a minimum, the test would likely contribute to North Korea's ability to develop a warhead that could be mounted on a long-range missile. It is unclear what impact a third nuclear test would have on future negotiations, but it would make their success far less likely. Observers are also waiting for evidence from test emissions that might show whether the North Koreans tested a uranium or plutonium device. This information could help determine the type and sophistication of the North Korean nuclear warhead design, about which little is known.\u00a9 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84896417913", "isbn": "9781626185401"}, "source": "Nuclear Weapons: Select Issues from the Global Arena", "authors": [{"first_name": "Mary Beth", "last_name": "Nikitin"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/north-koreas-nuclear-weapons-technical-issues-2", "year": 2013, "type": "book_section", "id": "7d228aa8-d521-3928-a4de-2f0e18c158b9"}, {"title": "Nuclear weapons", "abstract": "This chapter faces the realization that the same atoms that can produce life-saving electricity can also be used to construct weapons of mass destruction.

In the food systems of South Asia, the margin between cultivated and uncultivated biodiversity dissolves through women's day-to-day practice of collecting and cooking food, constituting a feminine landscape. The authors bring this practice to light, and demonstrate the value of food production and consumption systems that are localized rather than globalized. Based on extensive field research in India and Bangladesh, with and by farming communities, the book offers both people-based and evidence-based perspectives on the value of ecological farming, the survival strategies of the very poor, and the ongoing contribution of biodiversity to livelihoods. It also introduces new concepts such as \"the social landscape\" and \"the ethical relations underlying production systems\" relevant to key debates concerning the cultural politics of food sovereignty, land tenure, and the economics of food systems. Photographs of plants, crops and people, especially of women and children, showing their relationships with their environs, the seeds they preserve, the foods they gather and cook, and the recipes they exchange, are included. This book is recommended not only to those interested in food policy and food security or in agricultural systems and local knowledge systems, but also to those who are simply curious about other communities and food variety. The authors are leading activists and accomplished researchers with a long history of engagement with farming communities and the peasant world in South Asia and elsewhere. The book includes a DVD entitled \"Diversity and Food Sovereignty\" - a collection of three farmer-made films. Their message is loud and clear: food sovereignty means the conservation of biological diversity and revitalization of ethical community relations.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "20073130296", "isbn": "9788171885"}, "source": "Cultural Politics", "authors": [{"first_name": "Food", "last_name": "Sovereignty"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/food-sovereignty-uncultivated-biodiversity-south-asia-essays-poverty-food-policy", "year": 2007, "type": "book", "id": "f4e30754-ab2a-30f7-a077-6a48567b7bb8"}, {"title": "War, Food, and Politics in Early Hellenistic Athens", "abstract": "This book provides a new assessment of the economic history of Athens in the Hellenistic era, when the city was no longer an imperial power and struggled to maintain its territory, both at home in Attica and overseas in the cleruchies.

Application of an optimized quality and safety assurance system for the distribution of chilled and frozen products requires continuous monitoring and control of storage conditions. FRISBEE is a Food Refrigeration Innovation for Cold Chain European project. Within FRISBEE a user friendly web-based cold chain database (http://frisbee-wp2.chemeng.ntua.gr/coldchaindb/) is being built. At all stages of the cold chain, the needs of consumer and European industry were considered, gaining a greater insight into deviations between real cold chain data and targeted specifications. Systematic data collection and processing allowed identification and evaluation of the weak links of the cold chain of chilled and frozen products. Data from all stages (production to consumption) of the cold chain were collected from researchers, industry, distributors, retailers and consumers. The developed FRISBEE cold chain database web based platform linked to appropriate shelf-life predicting tools offers the potential to effectively manage and improve cold chain weak links using appropriate shelf-life decision systems leading to an optimized handling. Using the response of Time-Temperature Integrators (TTI), inexpensive, smart labels that show an easily measurable, time-temperature dependent change reflecting the temperature history of the food product, the integral effect of temperature can be monitored, and quantitatively translated to food safety and quality, from production to the point of consumption.

That's why fast fashion retailer H&M is now offering an annual $1 million prize for winners who can come up with better ways to recycle what we wear. It\u2019s one thing to rip the buttons and zippers out of a pair of pants, but quite another to separate the cotton and polyester in a mixed fabric. That\u2019s the challenge faced by retailers like H&M, which sell clothes so cheap that consumers face little incentive not to treat them as disposable. H&M already offers a garment collection service that distributes used clothing either to be reworn or reused (e.g., jeans turned into a purse or t-shirts used as cleaning cloths). The new yearly prize, administered by H&M\u2019s Conscious Foundation, is aimed at the third option: recycling. The prize will be distributed between five winners, and those winners will be chosen by public online vote. Anyone can enter, not just established companies. \"Ground-breaking, game-changing ideas can come from anywhere,\" says H&M CEO Karl-Johan Persson, \"so the challenge is open to anyone.\" H&M Winners will be flown to Stockholm, Sweden, to participate in an \"innovation bootcamp\" with the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The idea is that H&M will work with the winners to bring their ideas into actual use. H&M is known for its cheap and excellent knock-offs of catwalk collections, so it\u2019s ironic to see the company, the second-largest clothing retailer in the world, trying to lead the industry. \"I\u2019m also eager to see how the fashion industry as a whole will embrace the challenge of closing the loop,\" says Persson. Re-wearing, reuse, and recycling are all great ways for a large company like H&M to lessen its environmental impact, but the problem might be with its very business model. An alternative answer is for us to buy fewer, better-made clothes, and wear them for longer. The 10-year hoodie is one example of sustainable fashion, but the shift needs to come from consumers. H&M can\u2019t afford to sell fewer clothes, so it has to dress up recycling as a valid option.

Keyes traces the genre's history from its roots in West African bardic traditions, the Jamaican dancehall tradition, and African American vernacular expressions to its permeation of the cultural mainstream as a major tenet of hip-hop lifestyle and culture. Rap music, according to Keyes, is a forum that addresses the political and economic disfranchisement of black youths and other groups, fosters ethnic pride, and displays culture values and aesthetics. Blending popular culture with folklore and ethnomusicology, Keyes offers a nuanced portrait of the artists, themes, and varying styles reflective of urban life and street consciousness. Drawing on the music, lives, politics, and interests of figures including Afrika Bambaataa, the \"godfather of hip-hop,\" and his Zulu Nation, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, Grandmaster Flash, Kool \"DJ\" Herc, MC Lyte, LL Cool J, De La Soul, Public Enemy, Ice-T, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and The Last Poets, Rap Music and Street Consciousness challenges outsider views of the genre. The book also draws on ethnographic research done in New York, Los Angeles, Detroit and London, as well as interviews with performers, producers, directors, fans, and managers. Keyes's vivid and wide-ranging analysis covers the emergence and personas of female rappers and white rappers, the legal repercussions of technological advancements such as electronic mixing and digital sampling, the advent of rap music videos, and the existence of gangsta rap, Southern rap, acid rap, and dance-centered rap subgenres.

The high spin polarization, predicted in particular for Co2-based Heusler compounds, renders them prime candidates for electrode materials in spintronic devices such as giant magnetoresistance (GMR) elements or magnetic tunnel junctions and requires their implementation in thin film stacks. The growth of high quality Heusler films, however, demands their careful characterization. Typical issues in Heusler thin films are, besides the type and degree of structural order, the control of the film composition and the conservation of smooth interfaces between different layers in the film, e.g., between the Heusler layer and the tunneling barrier, while at the same time enabling high structural order. This review illustrates how nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy contributes to those issues by discussing recent examples of nuclear magnetic resonance studies of Heusler thin films.

In particular we focus on the characteristic magnetic-\u00afeld dependence, which is generally \u00aftted with either a Lorentzian or a, so-called, non-Lorentzian function. The shape is de- termined by both the hyper\u00afne \u00afelds and an additional broadening due to microscopic mechanisms, as described in the models. Within the present work, a new empirical function is introduced that captures the two e\u00aeects separately, and converges to the earlier introduced lineshapes in speci\u00afc limits. Recently it has been demonstrated that an additional feature can be observed at ultra- small magnetic \u00afelds. This e\u00aeect can be easily incorporated in our empirical approach by explicitly treating the limit in which hopping of carriers is no longer slow compared to spin precession in the hyper\u00afne \u00afelds. Our approach is used to analyze several theoretical and experimental results. It is shown that experimentally observed trends can be well understood, and important parameters can be obtained from experimental data without prior knowledge about which model applies.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84857697363", "doi": "10.1142/S2010324711000082", "isbn": "2010-3247\\r2010-3255", "issn": "2010-3247"}, "source": "Spin", "authors": [{"first_name": "W.", "last_name": "Wagemans"}, {"first_name": "P.", "last_name": "Janssen"}, {"first_name": "a.

In order to ensure that these algorithms actually make systems more reliable, we must ensure that these algorithms are actually correct. Unfortunately, model checking state-of-the-art fault-tolerant distributed algorithms (such as Paxos) is currently out of reach except for very small systems. In order to be eventually able to automatically verify such fault-tolerant distributed algorithms also for larger systems, several problems have to be addressed. In this paper, we consider modeling and verification of fault-tolerant algorithms that basically only contain threshold guards to control the flow of the algorithm. As threshold guards are widely used in fault-tolerant distributed algorithms (and also in Paxos), efficient methods to handle them bring us closer to the above mentioned goal. As a case study we use the reliable broadcasting algorithm by Srikanth and Toueg that tolerates even Byzantine faults. We show how one can model this basic fault-tolerant distributed algorithm in Promela such that safety and liveness properties can be efficiently verified in Spin.

The new emerging polity resembles a kind of neo-medieval empire with a polycentric system of government, multiple and overlapping jurisdictions, striking cultural and economic heterogeneity, fuzzy borders, and divided sovereignty. The book tries to spell out the origin, the shape, and the implications of this empire. The aim of this book is to suggest a novel way of thinking about the European Union and the process of European integration. The book shows 'two Europes' coming together following the end of the cold war. It proposes a system of economic and democratic governance that meets the ever greater challenges of modernization, interdependence, and globalization. It identifies the most plausible scenario of promoting peaceful change in Europe and beyond. The author argues that mainstream thinking about European integration is based on mistaken statist assumptions and suggests more effective and legitimate ways of governing Europe than through adoption of a European Constitution, creation of a European army, or introduction of a European social model.

Whereas many assume that Turks in Germany cannot share in the Jewish past, and that for them the genocide of the Jews is merely a borrowed memory, I show how intertwined the history of Turkey and Germany, Turkish and German anti-Semitism, and Turks and Jews are. Bringing together the histories of individual Turkish citizens who were Jewish or D\u00f6nme (descendants of Jews) in Nazi Berlin with the history of Jews in Turkey, I argue the categories \"Turkish\" and \"Jewish\" were converging identities in the Third Reich. Untangling them was a matter of life and death. I compare the fates of three neighbors in Berlin: Isaak Behar, a Turkish Jew stripped of his citizenship by his own government and condemned to Auschwitz; Fazli Taylan, a Turkish citizen and D\u00f6nme, whom the Turkish government exerted great efforts to save; and Eric Auerbach, a German Jew granted refuge in Turkey. I ask what is at stake for Germany and Turkey in remembering the narrative of the very few German Jews saved by Turkey, but in forgetting the fates of the far more numerous Turkish Jews in Nazi-era Berlin. I conclude with a discussion of the political effects today of occluding Turkish Jewishness by failing to remember the relationship between the first Turkish migration to Germany and the Shoah.

Similarly, in other studies, clomipramine was also found to have an analgesic effect. The sedative antidepressant amitriptyline has proved effective in migraine prophylaxis, chronic tension headache, and psychogenic musculoskeletal and neuralgic facial pain. Controlled studies have also shown pain-relief in patients with postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuralgia. In cases of predominantly psychogenic headache, idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and chronic neck and back pain, the sedative and anxiolytic antidepressant doxepin has been found to be an effective analgesic. As chronic pain patients are typically restless, irritable, and emotionally labile, sedative antidepressants tend to be prescribed in preference to stimulating drugs. Consequently, the compounds amitriptyline and doxepin have attracted increasing scientific interest in the field of algology. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the usefulness of these substances in treating chronic pain syndromes is incomplete in many areas. The remaining tricyclic and the tetracyclic antidepressants have not been sufficiently well evaluated. This is also true of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, of which individual reports to date suggest are probably also effective as analgesics.

Did the communist regime become more or less dictatorial within the confines of the so-called \"Antifascist Defense Rampart?\" Using film and literature, but also the GDR's losing battle against Beatlemania, Patrick Major's cross-disciplinary study suggests that popular culture both reinforced and undermined the closed society. Linking external and internal developments, Major argues that the GDR's official quest for international recognition, culminating in Ostpolitik and United Nations membership in the early 1970s, became its undoing, unleashing a human rights movement which fed into, but then broke with, the protests of 1989. After exploring the reasons for the fall of the Wall and reconstructing the heady days of the autumn revolution, the author reflects on the fate of the Wall after 1989, as it moved from demolition into the realm of memory.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84861567841", "doi": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199243280.001.0001", "isbn": "9780191714061", "issn": "1468-2745"}, "source": "Behind the Berlin Wall: East Germany and the Frontiers of Power", "authors": [{"first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "Major"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/behind-berlin-wall-east-germany-frontiers-power", "year": 2010, "keywords": ["Berlin wall", "East Germany", "Emigration", "Exit", "Freedom of travel", "GDR", "German democratic republic", "Loyalty", "Open border", "Popular opinion", "Republikflucht", "SED", "Socialist unity party of Germany", "Voice"], "type": "book", "id": "90c0b522-1b3d-3b79-8a4b-766132b86f74"}, {"title": "Heat transfer from the bottoms of vibrated vessels to stirred packings of spheres at atmospheric pressure and under vacuum", "abstract": "Heat transfer coefficients are measured from horizontal vibrated heating surfaces to stirred packings of spheres at atmospheric pressure and under vacuum.

The aim of this study was to examine, in a very large number of hyperprolactinemic patients, the ability to normalize PRL levels with cabergoline, to determine the effective dose and tolerance, and to assess the effect on clinical symptoms, tumor shrinkage, and visual field abnormalities. We also evaluated the effects of cabergoline in a large subgroup of patients with bromocriptine intolerance or -resistance. We retrospectively reviewed the files of 455 patients (102 males and 353 females) with pathological hyperprolactinemia treated with cabergoline in 9 Belgian centers. Among these patients, 41% had a microadenoma; 42%, a macroadenoma; 16%, idiopathic hyperprolactinemia; and 1%, an empty sella. The median pretreatment serum PRL level was 124 microg/L (range, 16-26,250 microg/L). A subgroup of 292 patients had previously been treated with bromocriptine, of which 140 showed bromocriptine intolerance and 58 showed bromocriptine resistance. Treatment with cabergoline normalized serum PRL levels in 86% of all patients: in 92% of 244 patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or a microprolactinoma and in 77% of 181 macroadenomas. Pretreatment visual field abnormalities normalized in 70% of patients, and tumor shrinkage was seen in 67% of cases. Side effects were noted in 13% of patients, but only 3.9% discontinued therapy because of side effects. The median dose of cabergoline at the start of therapy was 1.0 mg/week but could be reduced to 0.5 mg/week once control was achieved. Patients with a macroprolactinoma needed a higher median cabergoline dose, compared with those with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or a microprolactinoma: 1.0 mg/week vs. 0.5 mg/week, although a large overlap existed between these groups. Twenty-seven women treated with cabergoline became pregnant, and 25 delivered a healthy child. One patient had an intended abortion and another a miscarriage. In the patients with bromocriptine intolerance, normalization of PRL was reached in 84% of cases, whereas in the bromocriptine-resistant patients, PRL could be normalized in 70%. We confirmed, in a large-scale retrospective study, the high efficacy and tolerability of cabergoline in the treatment of pathological hyperprolactinemia, leaving few patients with unacceptable side effects or inadequate clinical response. Patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or a microprolactinoma, on average, needed only half the dose of cabergoline as those with macroprolactinomas and have a higher chance of obtaining PRL normalization. Cabergoline also normalized PRL in the majority of patients with known bromocriptine intolerance or -resistance. Once PRL secretion was adequately controlled, the dose of cabergoline could often be significantly decreased, which further reduced costs of therapy.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0033305762", "pmid": "10404830", "doi": "10.1210/jcem.84.7.5810", "arxiv": "Used C9", "issn": "0021972X"}, "source": "Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism", "authors": [{"first_name": "Johan", "last_name": "Verhelst"}, {"first_name": "Roger", "last_name": "Abs"}, {"first_name": "Dominique", "last_name": "Maiter"}, {"first_name": "Annick", "last_name": "Van Den Bruel"}, {"first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Vandeweghe"}, {"first_name": "Brigitte", "last_name": "Velkeniers"}, {"first_name": "Jean", "last_name": "Mockel"}, {"first_name": "Gerard", "last_name": "Lamberigts"}, {"first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "Petrossians"}, {"first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Coremans"}, {"first_name": "Charles", "last_name": "Mahler"}, {"first_name": "Achille", "last_name": "Stevenaert"}, {"first_name": "Jan", "last_name": "Verlooy"}, {"first_name": "Christian", "last_name": "Raftopoulos"}, {"first_name": "Albert", "last_name": "Beckers"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/cabergoline-treatment-hyperprolactinemia-study-455-patients", "year": 1999, "type": "journal", "id": "725ce1ec-128a-3a49-aed2-57e58c874c2d"}, {"title": "BDNF gene effects on brain circuitry replicated in 455 twins", "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in learning and memory, but its effects on the fiber architecture of the living brain are unknown.

A total of 227 sites were sampled from Cap d'Ailly to the Belgian border, from which a total of 167 species were collected. Species richness, abundance and biomass were all increased in the vicinity of outflows from harbours, major bays and estuaries. Three principal macrobenthic assemblages were defined: (i) an Ophelia borealis medium to fine sand assemblage; (ii) a muddy heterogeneous sediment assemblage; and (iii) an Abra alba muddy fine sand assemblage. The Abra alba assemblage covered approximately 80% of the seabed in the survey area. Sediment characteristics and a latitudinal gradient accounted for a significant proportion of the observed variability in assemblage distribution patterns.

Strong links between larval distribution and environmental parameters were identified, particularly for the younger stages which were found in higher abundance in areas of high chlorophyll-a concentration.

Trends in time-series were identified with dynamic linear models tailored to environmental monitoring data characteristics (e.g. irregular sampling frequency, missing data). Temporal and spatial patterns in the phytoplankton community were explained with a partial triadic analysis. Relationships between the phytoplankton community composition, environmental factors, and climatic indices were assessed using a redundancy analysis (RDA). The analyses revealed long-term changes in the community composition, characterized by a temporal structure that remained common to all transects. The abundance of some groups of taxa such as the one composed by Gymnodinium and Gyrodinium, as well as the group of Pseudo-nitzschia increased during the study period, whereas the abundance of other taxa as for example Guinardia and the group of Coscinodiscus and Stellarima globally decreased. More generally, the proportion of dinoflagellates relative to diatoms increased. Trends in environmental variables were also observed in most sites and related to decreases in nutrient concentrations and an increasing trend in salinity.

The neutral state stood in the middle, between the globe's conflicting forces. It connoted a certain decency, cold and formal perhaps, but incompatible with the concealment of Nazi plunder or other skulduggery. But neutrality, like virtue, is seldom absolute. Applied to the acts of a state during several years of war, the adjective ''neutral'' is almost inevitably inadequate. Wars are hell. But they are also opportunity. They are generally long, made up of hard, grinding days that do not naturally nourish man's nobler instincts. The neutral states of World War II -- among them Switzerland, Sweden and Portugal -- composed their neutrality day after day. The Swiss did not want the Germans in Geneva but did not have an army that could stop them from getting there. The Portuguese, led by a fascist, were worried about what the British might do to their African colonies. The Swedes needed German coal and the Germans needed Swedish iron ore. Such equations -- involving geography, economic interest, historical ties, strategic aims and emotional sympathies -- defined policy. Survival mattered above all. Morality was secondary, if that; which is where the gold and the assets of Jewish victims of Hitler come in. It has become clear in recent months that money, gold, paintings and other items that belonged to Holocaust victims were deposited in Swiss banks by the Nazis or by the victims themselves during Hitler's rule. The extent of these deposits and their ultimate fate remain unclear. But the apparent failure of the Swiss banking community to give a clear accounting of its dealings with the Nazis has fueled an increasingly venomous exchange between Jewish groups and the Swiss authorities. The image of Switzerland -- comforting because neutral -- has taken on a darker hue. In the place of chocolates, cute little cottages and kindly burghers, another Switzerland has emerged, suspicious of Jewish ''blackmail'' and cabals, unsure what guilt, if any, to admit. In the Swiss wake, Portugal and Sweden have also arrived in the historical dock. Their governments' apparent lack of interest in the source of the Nazi gold they received in exchange for sales to Germany of tungsten, wood, sardines and iron ore has been widely criticized. As in Switzerland, the suspicion has emerged that they profited from the Nazi conquest, and genocide, and that their neutrality was simply a cloak for connivance. ''Sweden was not neutral, Sweden was weak,'' said Arne Ruth, a Swedish journalist who has written a book on the Third Reich. ''Its sales of iron ore made an important contribution to the German effort. It allowed German troops and weaponry through its territory to Norway. In 1943, its government told the central bank to ignore suspicions that German gold Sweden received was looted. What is interesting is that all these facts, more or less known for some time, are commanding such attention now.'' There is no question that recently declassified documents, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in 1995, and unprecedented access to archives in Moscow and other ex-Communist states have all played a role in reopening discussion of the war and turning events of long ago into news. But there seems to be more to the current debate than new documents alone can explain. The cold war, an era of moral absolutism, has given way to an age in which even ''good'' states can be bad, or at least reveal their imperfections. An age where neutrality itself is necessarily relative. ''Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, we tended to imbue ourselves with a facile purity in the West,'' said Andre Glucksmann, a French philosopher. ''We blamed the other and did not look too closely at ourselves. We glossed over the corner of neutrality in most people, the neutrality that is also the instinct to save one's skin.'' Truth and Cynicism The extent to which the ''truth'' about World War II was shaped by the often cynical political imperatives of the postwar years is now becoming clear. As the British historian Norman Davies has pointed out, the only war crimes deemed worth investigating in 1945 ''were those committed by the defeated enemy.'' There was, for example, no appetite to discover who killed 26,000 Allied Polish officers in the Katyn forests in 1941 because the Soviet Union, at war's end, was an ally. Later, the issue was simply buried in the Soviet sphere. Similarly, Western attempts to probe who killed whom in Yugoslavia between 1941 and 1945 -- and particularly the role of the Catholic church in quisling Croatia's genocidal drive against Serbs and Jews -- were scarcely serious because they met political objections. To look too closely was to destabilize Yugoslavia; and to criticize the Catholic church was to play into the hands of the Communists. The truth, beside such calculations, was of little moment. Politics was paramount. The same is certainly true of Switzerland, Sweden and Portugal, states that all became part of the Western family after 1945. Portugal, still under its dictator Antonio Salazar, entered NATO. Switzerland and Sweden were lands of freedom and democracy. Pressing them on their war records was not a priority in the West. Immediately after the war, the United States did attempt to press Portugal to surrender 44 tons of German gold by freezing its assets in the United States. But seven years later, with America anxious to get Portugal into NATO and secure an important strategic base in the Azores, the matter was dropped. In Switzerland, as in Sweden, the facts of an uneven war record have been broadly known for some time. Switzerland let some Jewish refugees in, but it turned others away. It secured food and other supplies from Germany and Fascist Italy; its bankers did business with both. Especially in the later years of the war, it proved a valuable listening post for Allied intelligence services. ''The romantic idea of the Swiss citizen army standing between it and disaster in the war was always nonsense,'' said Arno J. Mayer, a professor of history at Princeton University. ''Given the fact it borders Germany, it was natural for it to lean more toward the Axis powers. It is the new spirit of our times that has led to the current scrutiny.'' That spirit has also been evident elsewhere. It is only recently, in 1995, that France has fully acknowledged its responsibility in the deportation of Jews and only recently that the early Allied awareness of the Holocaust has become widely acknowledged. The truth, with its inevitable moral ambiguities, can now be told. Part of this questioning spirit seems to have stemmed from the disasters that followed the cold war's end. The genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda posed -- shockingly -- a basic question: and what did you do? Fewer Certainties Faced by this question, the old, neat certainties about history, about who was good and who evil, who upstanding and who a coward, have tended to fall away. The fact is that the ''neutral'' in any war or crisis -- those, that is, who rest immobile or are borne along with the tide -- are far more numerous than the outright heroes or the outright villains. What has also become very clear in recent years is the importance of light being shed on history. Yugoslavia's destruction, in many ways, was an old war refought. The obfuscations of Swiss banks and the Swiss Government, the shredding of old documents and the retreat into invective appear to do no service to future generations of Swiss citizens. Our vision of wartime ''neutrality'' was an illusion. But so, too, in some ways, was our vision of ourselves. The neutral countries were imperfect, but perhaps we were all less perfect than we believed. Photo: Swiss soldiers in gas masks take part in a training exercise in 1940.

The modern woman, by contrast, was partner to a new model of marriage, one in which she and her husband formed a relationship based on greater sexual and psychological equality. In Making Marriage Modern, Christina Simmons narrates the development of this new companionate marriage ideal, which took hold in the early twentieth century and prevailed in American society by the 1940s. The first challenges to public reticence to discuss sexual relations between husbands and wives came from social hygiene reformers, who advocated for a scientific but conservative sex education to combat prostitution and venereal disease. A more radical group of feminists, anarchists, and bohemians opposed the Victorian model of marriage and even the institution of marriage. Birth control advocates such as Emma Goldman and Margaret Sanger openly championed women's rights to acquire and use effective contraception. The \"companionate marriage\" emerged from these efforts. This marital ideal was characterized by greater emotional and sexuality intimacy for both men and women, use of birth control to create smaller families, and destigmatization of divorce in cases of failed unions. Simmons examines what she calls the \"flapper\" marriage, in which free-spirited young wives enjoyed the early years of marriage, postponing children and domesticity. She looks at the feminist marriage in which women imagined greater equality between the sexes in domestic and paid work and sex. And she explores the African American \"partnership marriage,\" which often included wives' employment and drew more heavily on the involvement of the community and extended family.

Though male dominance persisted in companionate marriages, Christina Simmons shows how they called for greater independence and satisfaction for women and a new female heterosexuality.

Veterans are a braod population spanning frm those who served in Workd War II (WWII) to recent veterans who were on active duty during the post-9/11 period know as Gulf War-era II. Although most veterans are men, women are a growing part of the veteran population, accounting for 8.1 percent of all veterans in 2010.3 As with the nation at large, younger veterans are more racially and ethnically diverse than older veterans. Among living veterans in 2010, racial minorities accounted for over one in five veterans who served during the Gulf War-era, compared to only one in ten among older veterans who served during WWII, the Korean War, and the Vietnam era.4 Hispanic veterans are also more prevalent among recent service members than among those from previous wars. In 2010, Hispanics accounted for 11.1 percent of all Gulf War-era II veterans, versus only 3.9 percent of veterans who served during WWII, the Korean War, and the Vietnam era.5 This report examines employment and unemployment information about veterans and shows how they have been faring in the economic recovery.

Drawing on oral testimony, unpublished correspondence, archival records, memoirs, and diaries, Robert F. Jefferson explores the curious contradiction of war-effort idealism and entrenched discrimination through the experiences of the 93rd Infantry Division. Led by white officers and presumably unable to fight-and with the army taking great pains to regulate contact between black soldiers and local women-the division was largely relegated to support roles during the advance on the Philippines, seeing action only later in the war when U.S. officials found it unavoidable. Jefferson discusses racial policy within the War Department, examines the lives and morale of black GIs and their families, documents the debate over the deployment of black troops, and focuses on how the soldiers' wartime experiences reshaped their perspectives on race and citizenship in America. He finds in these men and their families incredible resilience in the face of racism at war and at home and shows how their hopes for the future provided a blueprint for America's postwar civil rights struggles. Integrating social history and civil rights movement studies, Fighting for Hope examines the ways in which political meaning and identity were reflected in the aspirations of these black GIs and their role in transforming the face of America. \u00a9 2008 The Johns Hopkins University Press.

First, morphological preprocessing is applied to suppress sidelobes. Second, based on Hough transform (HT), the orientation of the principal axis is extracted, and the modified minimum enclosing rectangle (MER) of the ship is obtained and rotated along the principal axis. Finally, the ship type is decided according to the width ratio of MER between the HT line, the ratio of ship and nonship points on the principal axis, and the scattering density.

Collision and amalgamation of smaller and rocky planetesimals within a protoplanetary disk formed the terrestrial planets, including Earth. As proto-Earth and its Moon grew by these violent accretion processes, earlier differentiation products were largely obliterated. With the growth of embryonic planets, the impact rate decreased and concomitantly, the likelihood of preservation of fragments of the early Earth increased. Because of the rapid formation of Earth, its latter-stage collision with a small number of massive planetesimals and its internal heating by radioactive decay and release of gravitational energy associated with core formation, it almost certainly passed through a \u201cmagma ocean\u201d stage in its accretion history.

These problems may be overcome if the Chortis block is back-rotated anticlockwise about a pole near Santiago, Chile, i.e. ~1100 km along the Cayman transform faults during the Cenozoic. Such a reconstruction when combined with reconstructions of features in the Pacific Ocean, suggests that Middle Miocene collision of the Tehuantepec aseismic ridge with the Acapulco Trench led to: (1) asymmetric flattening of the subduction zone; (2) an anticlockwise rotation of the Mexican mag- matic arc to its present location by the Middle Miocene; (3) the development of a volcanic arc gap in southeastern Mexico, in which the late Middle Miocene Chiapas fold-and-thrust belt developed: as the Tehuantepec Ridge swept westward, arc volcanism was re-established in the gap. Eocene colli- sion of the Chumbia Seamount Ridge (inferred mirror image of the Moonless Mountains\u2013unnamed seamount ridge between the Molokai and Clarion fracture zones) with the Acapulco Trench followed by its ESE migration during the Oligocene led to: (a) flattening of the subducting slab inducing subduction erosion and exhumation of the southern Mexican margin; (b) anticlockwise rotation of the volcanic arc; and (c) sinistral strike-slip faulting in the Sierra Madre del Sur.

Why study Numerical Geology? Although geologists have dabbled in numbers since the time of Hutton and Playfair, 200 years ago (Merriam 1981e), geology until recently lagged behind other sciences in both the teaching and geological application of mathematics, statistics and computers. Geology Departments incorporating these disciplines in their undergraduate courses are still few (particularly outside the USA). Only two international geomathematical/computing journals are published (Computers & Geosciences; Mathematical Geology), compared with dozens covering, say, petrology or mineralogy. It also remains common practice for years (and $1000s) to be spent setting up computerized machines to produce large volumes of data in machine-readable form, and then for geologists to plot these by hand on a sheet of graph paper! Despite this, the use of numerical methods in geology has now begun to increase at a rate which implies a revolution of no less importance than the plate tectonic revolution of the 1960's -- one whose impact is beginning to be felt throughout the academic, commercial, governmental and private consultative geological communities (Merriam 1969, 1981c). Although a few pioneers have been publishing benchmark papers for some years, the routine usage of machine-based analytical techniques, and the advent of low-priced desk-top microcomputers, have successively enabled and now at last persuaded many more geologists to become both numerate and computerate. Merriam (1980) estimated that two decades of increasing awareness had seen the percentage of geomathematical papers (sensu lato) rise to some 15% of all geological literature; meanwhile, mineralogy-petrology and geochemistry had both fallen to a mere 5% each! In these Notes, geomathematics and numerical geology are used interchangeably, to cover applications of mathematics, statistics and computing to processing real geological data. However, as applications which primarily store or retrieve numbers (e.g. databases) are included, as well as those involving actual mathematical calculations, 'Numerical Geology' is preferred in the title. 'Geomathematics' in this sense should not be confused with 'geostatistics', now usually restricted to a specialised branch of geomathematics dealing with ore body estimation (\u00a720). Reasons for studying Numerical Geology can be summarised as follows: (1) Volumes of new and existing numerical data: The British Geological Survey, the world's oldest, recently celebrated its 150th anniversary by establishing a National Geoscience data-centre, in which it is hoped to store all accumulated records on a computer (Lumsden & Flowarth 1986). Information already existing in the Survey's archives is believed to amount to tens or hundreds of Gb (i.e. = 1010-11 characters) and to be increasing by a few percent annually. The volumes of valuable data existing in the worM's geological archives, over perhaps 250 years of geological endeavour, must therefore be almost immeasurably greater. It is now routine even for students to produce hundreds or thousands of multi-element analyses for a single thesis, while national programs of geochemical sampling easily produce a million individual dement values. Such volumes of data simply cannot be processed realistically by manual means; they require mathematical and statistical manipulation on computers -- in some cases large computers. (2) Better use of coded/digitised data: In addition to intrinsically numerical (e.g. chemical) data, geology produces much information which can be more effectively used if numerically coded. For example, relatively little can be done with records of, say, 'limestone' and 'sandstone' in a borehole log, but very much more can be done if these records are numerically coded as 'limestone = 1' and 'sandstone = 2'. Via encoding, enormous volumes of data are opened to computer processing which would otherwise have lain dormant. More importantly, geological maps - perhaps the most important tool of the entire science - can themselves be digitised (turned into large sets of numbers), opening up vast new possibilities for manipulation, revision, scale-change and other improvements. (3) Intelligent data use: It is absurd to acquire large volumes of data and then not to interpret them fully. Field geologists observing an outcrop commonly split into two (or more) groups, arguing perhaps over the presence or absence of a preferred orientation in kyanite crystals on a schist foliation surface. The possibility of actually measuring these orientations and analyzing them statistically (\u00a717) is rarely aired-- at last in this author's experience! Petrologists are equally culpable when they rely on X-Y or, at maximum 'sophistication', X-Y-Z (triangular) variation diagrams, in representing the evolution of igneous rocks which have commonly been analyzed for up to 50 elements! Whereas some geological controversies (especially those based on interpretation of essentially subjective field observations) cannot be resolved numerically, many others can and should be. This is not to say (as Lord Kelvin did) that quantitative science is the only good science, but qualitative treatment of quantitative data is rarely anything but bad science. (4) Literature search and data retrieval: Most research projects must begin with reviews of the literature and, frequently, with exhaustive compilations of existing data. These are essential if informed views on the topic are to be reached, existing work is not merely to be duplicated, and optimum use is to be made of available funding, The ever-expanding geological literature, however, makes such reviews and compilations increasingly time-consuming and expensive via traditional manual means. Use of the increasing number of both bibliographical and analytical databases (\u00a73) is therefore becoming a prequisite for well-informed, high-quality research. (5) Unification of interests: In these days of inexorably increasing specialisation in ever narrower topics, brought about by the need to keep abreast of the exploding literature, numerical geology forms a rare bridge between different branches not only of geology but of diverse other sciences. The techniques covered in this book are equally applicable (and in many cases have been in routine use for far longer) in biology, botany, geography, medicine, psychology, sociology, zoology, etc. Within geology itself, most topics covered here are as valuable to the stratigrapher as to the petrologist. 'Numerical geologists' are thus in the unique (and paradoxical) position of being both specialists and non-specialists; they may have their own interests, but their numerical and computing knowledge can often help all of their colleagues. (6) Employment prospects: There is a clear and increasing demand for computerate/numerate geologists in nearly all employment fields. In Australia, whose economy is dominated by geology-related activities (principally mining), a comprehensive national survey (AMIRA 1985) estimated that A$40M per annum could be saved by more effective use of computers in geology. Professional computer scientists are also of course in demand, but the inability of some of their number to communicate with 'laymen' is legendary! Consequently, many finns have perpetual need for those rare animals who combine knowledge of computing and mathematics with practical geological experience. Their unique bridging role also means that numerical geologists are less likely to be affected by the vaguaries of the employment market than are more specialised experts. Rationale and aims of this book This is a highly experimental book, constituting the interim text for new (1988) courses in 'Numerical Geology' at the University of Western Australia. It is published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences series precisely because, as the rubric for this series has it, \"the timeIiness of a manuscript is more important than its form, which may be unfinished or tentative.\" Readers are more than welcome to send constructive comments to the author, such that a more seasoned, comprehensive version can be created in due course. Readers' indulgence is meanwhile craved for the number of mistakes which must inevitably remain in a work involving so many citations and cross-references. Emphasis is particularly placed on the word Notes in the series rifle: this book is not a statistical or mathematical treatise. It is not intended to stand on its own, but rather to complement and target the existing literature. It is most emphatically not a substitute for sound statistical knowledge, and indeed, descriptions of each technique are deliberately minimized such that readers shouM never be tempted to rely on this book alone, but should rather read around the subject in the wealth of more authoritative statistical and geomathematical texts cited. In other words, this is a synoptic work, principally about 'how to do', 'when not to do', 'what are the alternatives' and 'where to find out more'. It aims specifically: (1) to introduce geologists to the widest possible range of numerical methods which have already appeared in the literature; and thus (2) to infuse geologists with just sufficient background knowledge that they can: (a) locate more detailed sources of information; (b) understand the broad principles behind interpreting most common geological problems quantitatively; (c) appreciate how to take best advantage of computers; and thereby (d) cope with the \"information overload\" (Griffiths 1974) which they increasingly face. Even these aims require the reader to become to some extent geologist, computer scientist, mathematician and statistician rolled into one, and a practical balance has therefore been attempted, in which just enough information is hopefully given to expedite correct interpretation and avoidance of pitfalls, but not too much to confuse or deter the reader.

In the close environment of the ore the silicic metavolcanites, rhyolitic in composition, and the more mafic rocks have been chemically altered; hence, they are enriched in potassium, iron, and magnesium and depleted in sodium and calcium. The metamorphic derivatives of the altered volcanites are sericite schists and cordierite-anthophyllite rocks. The ore deposit, which is syngenetic with silicic volcanites, was folded during polyphase deformation. The orebody averages 0.85 percent Cu, 2.8 percent Zn, 37 percent S, 33 percent Fe, 0.2 g/ton Au, and 14 g/ton Ag. The main gangue minerals are quartz, barite, and local carbonates. The data presented indicate a fairly constant isotope composition of sulfur with an average value of 34 S of +7.5 per mil for pyrite. Isotopic dating of intrusive and supracrustal rocks yields ages of about 1,900 m.y. for the metavolcanites but a somewhat higher age (1,932 + or - 1.5 m.y.) for the gneissic granite, east of the schist belt. The lead isotope compositions of the galena in the Pyhaesalmi ore and its silicic metavolcanite hosts lie on the same isochron within limits of experimental uncertainty.

Thereby, 6 different sites (Bottaro West, Bottaro North, Point 21, Hot Lake, Black Point and Area 26) of a submarine fumarolic field, existing at depths between 8 and 30 m, were sampled by scuba diving. Several geochemical (on-site parameters, photometry, ISE, IC, ICP-MS) and isotopic analyses (\u03b4D, \u03b418O, \u03b413C, \u03b434S, 87Sr/86Sr, 3He/4He) were accomplished on water and gas samples in order to improve the understanding of the hydro-chemical processes and physico-chemical conditions which are responsible for the formation of the fluids. Seawater mixing has a strong influence on the fluid chemistry. Nevertheless, the chemical composition of the fluid samples displays large differences. By means of 87Sr/86Sr ratios and semi-numeric calculations, dilution factors were determined and the probable composition of emitting fluids without the influence of seawater was calculated. Two distinct water types were found to exist, presented by the locations Hot Lake (HL) and Black Point (BP). Reservoir temperatures of 345C and 310C were estimated by using Na/K and K/Mg geothermometers for the two water types. The substantial enrichment of many major cations and anions as well as Li, Rb, Fe, Cs, I, Ba, Zn, Pb, As (up to 10,000 times) in both fluids gives evidence of intense water-rock interactions in the reservoir. Furthermore, light \u03b413C, \u03b434S values and high 3He/4He ratios (R/Ra ~ 4.36) of the gas samples indicate the contribution of a deep magmatic component. Variations in the chloride contents of up to 130 % of normal seawater point towards phase separation processes in the underground which are responsible for the formation of the highly-saline end-members of Hot Lake and Black Point. Differences between these two water types occur with regard to the chondrite normalised REE pattern and the measured redox values among others. This points to different physico-chemical conditions, probably due to local input of magmatic gases.

Mayan languages are characterized by shared phonological features, such as a glottalized series of consonants, and by common grammatical properties, including ergativity, positional roots, directional particles, and noun and numeral classifiers. Mayan languages have phonological systems with 5-10 vowels. Vowel distinctions may include length as well as quality differences. Yucatec Maya and Sakapulteko have been described as having phonemic tone as well. Some grammatical descriptions further differentiate syllabic nuclei as 'simple' i.e. long or short vowel only, or 'complex' a vowel 'broken' or followed by a glottal stop or a vowel +/h/combination. Obstruents are generally paired in glottalized and non-glottalized series. The sonorants often devoice in word final or pre-voiceless environments.

Well-developed ICT infrastructure does not only enhance the work environment, it, in fact, facilitates teaching, learning, research and publication.\u201d   She said that \u201cworld class universities must establish long traditions of excellence in their academic and non-academic activities,\u201d adding that such universities must produce \u201cglobally employable and competitive graduates.\u201d  Emodi posited that such world-class universities must have globally recognised academic staff in research and publications, \u201coffer academic programmes and environment that attract the best students and staff from all over the world.\u201d   She said, \u201cSuch countries as Qatar, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates have made bold efforts to promote internationalisation as a matter as national policies.

It is ultimately based on G. I. Taylor's 1934 theory of work hardening wherein he assumed that stress application causes the essentially instantaneous athermal generation of dislocation structures which are in equilibrium with the applied stress and which on stress release and reversal are stable up to the previously highest stress magnitude. As will be shown, at least in principle even though many details are still lacking, the following phenomena of crystal plasticity are readily explained by means of the LEDS theory: (1) the four stages of work hardening; (2) the shape of the stress-strain curve; (3) the temperature dependence of work hardening; (4) the low-temperature strain rate dependence of the flow stress; (5) the difference between 'planar' and 'wavy' glide materials (as exemplified by ?-brass and copper respectively); (6) the empirical relationship D = KGb/? between dislocation cell size and flow stress; (7) grain-boundary hardening; (8) alloy hardening including solid-solution, precipitation and phase-boundary hardening; (9) slip lines and slip bands; (10) the evolution of the dislocation structures from stages I to IV; (11) deformation texture evolution; (12) work softening; (13) the thermodynamics of dislocation storage; (14) recovery, creep and recrystallization; (15) the development of dislocation structures in fatigue. All these are explained effortlessly on the basis of only the known properties of glide dislocations and the second law of thermodynamics, as expressed in the LEDS hypothesis, to wit that, among the structures which are in equilibrium with the applied tractions and accessible to the dislocations, those are formed which most nearly minimize the stored energy. (See Note added in proof at end of this paper.) The alternative 'self-organizing dislocation' model of crystal plasticity assumes plastic deformation to be due to individual thermally activated processes, which are treatable by the thermodynamics of energy-flow-through systems. It can be traced back to the early theory by R. Becker in 1925 and 1926 and still has to yield significant results.", "identifiers": {"doi": "10.1080/14786430601019433", "isbn": "0141861820823"}, "source": "Philosophical Magazine", "authors": [{"first_name": "Publisher", "last_name": "Taylor"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/philosophical-magazine-155", "year": 2007, "type": "journal", "id": "df6a3e47-756a-35ad-b940-5fd561fee112"}, {"title": "ESL Magazine", "abstract": "The six issues in this volume include the following articles: \"Preview of TESOL 2001\" (Adelaide Heyde Parsons); \"Six Internet Pioneers Teach English to the World\" (Dennis Oliver, Randall Davis, Elaine Hoter, Charles Kelly, Dave Sperling, and Ruth Vilmi); \"Integrated Skills in the ESL/EFL Classroom\" (Rebecca Oxford); \"English Language Education in Cuba\" (Tony Irizar); \"Incubation: A Neglected Aspect of the Writing Process\" (StePhen Krashen); \"Effective Reading Instruction for ESL Students\" (David and Yvonne Freeman); \"Conflict Resolution: What Teachers and Students Should Know\" (Anita Wenden); \"English Language Education in Japan\" (Hideko Ogose); \"Rethinking Classroom Management: Creating an Effective Learning Community\" (JoAnn Crandall); \"Harry Potter and the English Language Learner\" (Kathy Coatney) ; \"How Good is Your Vocabulary Program\" (Paul Nation); \"New Professional Development Strategies\" (Kirsten Schaetzel and Liz England); \"Picture Your Students Talking: Using Pictures in the Language Classroom\" (Andy Curtis and Kathleen M.

This was a well-defined genre. When Robert Louis Stevenson completed his Ur-adventure story, Treasure Island, he said he'd written it `for boys'.

Some of Stevenson's successors reflected the drama of empire quite explicitly.

Using the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Insurance Policy Simulation Model (HIPSM), we estimate how the ACA would affect the types of health insurance coverage Americans have, the number of those without insurance, and America\u2019s overall spending on health care. For ease of comparison, we simulate the ACA as if fully implemented in 2010 and contrast the results with HIPSM\u2019s pre-reform baseline results for 2010. Our single-year estimates complement the 10-year cost estimates previously released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary, providing many results\u2014particularly for coverage and transitions in coverage\u2014that are either new or broken out by more detailed characteristics than in either of those estimates. We estimate that \u00bb\u00bb Under the ACA, the share of nonelderly adults without health insurance would decline by 27.8 million, from 18.6 to 8.3 percent. The number of uninsured would decline for all income categories, but the lowest-income would see the greatest declines. For example, the number of nonelderly uninsured below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) would drop by 19.4 million. \u00bb\u00bb Nearly 30 percent of those at all income levels who would have been uninsured without reform would be covered by Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), nearly 20 percent would be covered under the new health insurance exchanges, and an additional 10 percent would be covered by private insurance outside the exchanges. The other 40 percent would remain uninsured. \u00bb\u00bb Nearly 40 percent of those who would still be uninsured under the ACA are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP but would choose not to enroll. Just over a quarter would be undocumented immigrants who are ineligible for public insurance coverage or the coverage in new exchanges. \u00bb\u00bb Total spending on acute health care for the non-elderly by the government, employers, and individuals would increase by 4.5 percent under the ACA (excluding the savings from multiyear provisions) if it were fully implemented in 2010. Multiyear provisions such as Medicare and Medicaid savings and cost-containment programs were not simulated. Total costs to employers would be largely unchanged. Spending for most individuals would not change significantly, though many of those currently uninsured but ineligible for Medicaid or the most generous premium subsidies would spend more on premiums for new health insurance or individual mandate penalties. \u00bb\u00bb The cost of uncompensated care provided to the uninsured would drop by 61 percent. These reductions would allow federal and state governments to reduce spending on programs that now support the uninsured (not in our government baseline). Less uncompensated care could also result in lower private premiums and higher provider revenue. \u00bb\u00bb The expansion of Medicaid would enroll 13.1 million new adults and 3.7 million new children. The newly enrolled adults would be much less expensive to cover, on average, than current adult Medicaid enrollees. \u00bb\u00bb We estimate that 43.8 million nonelderly persons would be covered through health insurance exchanges. About half of these, 23.1 million, would be covered by nongroup (i.e., individually purchased, not employer-related) insurance purchased in the health insurance exchanges. The remainder would obtain coverage in an exchange through their employer.", "authors": [{"first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Buettgens"}], "source": "Robert", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/america-under-affordable-care-act-1", "year": 2010, "type": "journal", "id": "5e1d2b43-fcb8-35da-9911-a064df944392"}, {"title": "Elastic stress field beneath an arbitrary axisymmetric punch", "abstract": "The nanoindentation test is commonly used for the local determination of mechanical properties (hardness, elastic modulus. etc.) and also to study the initial stages of plasticity (dislocation nucleation, dislocation interaction mechanisms) at the nanometre scale.

The knowledge of the stress and strain fields produced close to the corners of the punch under different loading conditions as a function of the friction coefficient will allow insight to be gained into the fretting fatigue problem associated to this cyclic loading. In order to better understand the behaviour and analyze the possibility of using fracture mechanics approaches to study the stress field close to the punch corners, two different models have been compared to each other: one without continuity solution between the punch and the substrate and the other with a couple of contact surfaces between them. Using the continuous model, a particularization of the general analytic solutions of Williams has been proposed. The complete stress field around the corners of the punch for this model has been obtained for any values of the punch size, normal and shear loads. Some general guides for understanding and systematizing the punch-substrate behaviour have been extracted from the above solution and that of a sliding wedge, provided by the literature, which enable a systematic numerical analysis of the problem. Further on, a more detailed study of the slip between punch and substrate, as well as of the stress field, has been accomplished using finite element analysis guided by the previous semi-analytical results. The study has been completed for the whole load process: compressive normal load, monotonic shear load, and cyclic shear load. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These scholars are all guided by the same principle: to encourage the establishment of an interdisciplinary and trans-national dialogue in order to work out new approaches capable of integrating and acknowledging different or even opposing ways to perceive and interpret the same historical phenomenon. While assessing the way the memories of the two World Wars have been readjusted each time in relation to the evolving international historical setting and through various mediators of memory (cinema, literature, art and monuments), the various essays contribute to unveil a cultural panorama inhabited by contrasting memories and by divided memories not to emphasise divisions, but to acknowledge the ethical need for a truly shared act of reconciliation.

Instead, it seeks to make sense of the animal welfare issues associated with all forms of slaughter according to current understanding of consciousness, sensibility, the processes of death, pain, the distress that may arise from emotions of fear and anxiety and the subjective states of anger, rage, panic and in extreme cases, terror or frenzy. This review specifies the risks to animal welfare that accompany the slaughter of livestock (cattle, sheep and goats), including where insensibility has not been produced by electrical or mechanical stunning. Scientific opinions on the slaughter of livestock from the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) provide important background by distilling the results of specific investigations into livestock slaughter. It is unnecessary to retrace the same steps. As a result, new ground can be explored and the present review is distinctive in two ways. 1. The review is purposefully linked to the principles of risk management. These are seen to provide a practical and equitable means for combining respect for religious belief with improvements to animal welfare. 2. The review looks to general physiology as explained in standard textbooks and selected review articles to provide ways, means and criteria for understanding and interpreting specific studies on humane slaughter of livestock. The intent is to package evidence from science in a way that can inform public policy determination by decision makers in Australia. If all other animal welfare risks have been managed and made equal, there are two animal welfare differences between the slaughter of livestock with and without stunning. These are: 1. the response to handling and restraint for the specific purpose of making the neck incision and 2. the sensation of physical pain and perceived distress caused by the incision plus physiological responses to acute blood loss in the conscious animal. Physical pain and all other subjective experiences will disappear as soon as insensibility from blood loss commences and, providing the incision causes irreversible blood loss, will remain absent until death supervenes. Risks associated with slaughter of non-stunned animals are best understood by contrast with the risks associated with slaughter of stunned animals. Some factors that modulate welfare risks are common to all forms of slaughter, but may result in dissimilar animal welfare outcomes under different forms of slaughter, even if experienced in the same way at the time of occurrence. The review begins with descriptions of general slaughter and Halal and Kosher slaughter. It summarises the welfare concerns associated with all forms of slaughter. The review then delves into the historical context of livestock slaughter and gives a general picture of risk management. This sets the scene for specifying the animal welfare risks associated with non-stunned slaughter of livestock. Biological aspects of 1. consciousness and unconsciousness, 2. death and the process of dying, 3. pain, and 4. distress related to the emotions of fear, anxiety, rage and anger, are outlined according to current standard textbooks of physiology and veterinary medicine, with help from some reviews selected from biomedical journals. These outlines of common but critical biological processes in ruminants extend to other mammals and aim at an understanding that can be applied when 1. stunning, 2. the connection between heart and brain function, 3. exsanguination or bleeding out, and 4. the restraint of animals, are explored from the perspective of pathogenesis or pathophysiology. Pathogenesis or pathophysiology explains the biological impact of external agents or events that impact on the balance of biological systems underpinning the normal functioning of the interrelated organ systems in animals. If it is properly understood, rational treatments can be devised where such events may lead to propagation of disturbances in biological function. In the present instance the review has a particular focus on the pathophysiology of exsanguination and its links to irreversible loss of higher brain centre awareness of the perceived world (interpreted as \u2018consciousness\u2019). This will assist in better understanding the scope of animal welfare risks specific to slaughter of livestock without prior stunning. The review ends by specifying those risks. Some general ideas about possible risk management are then provided and three recommendations are made.", "authors": [{"first_name": "David B.", "last_name": "Adams"}, {"first_name": "Allan D.", "last_name": "Sheridan"}], "source": "Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/specifying-risks-animal-welfare-associated-livestock-slaughter-without-induced-insensibility", "year": 2008, "type": "journal", "id": "31de4518-33bc-3a75-906f-a12aa0977e9e"}, {"title": "Hoover Dam: First Joint Venture and Construction Milestones in Excavation, Geology, Materials Handling, and Aggregates", "abstract": "The size of the Boulder Canyon Project necessitated a broad array of innovations in construction engineering and management which had enormous impacts on all of the large scale projects that followed it.

Over 1,500 buildings were constructed to house the 5,000 plus dam workers, making Boulder City the third largest city in Nevada. DeBoer gained experience with the Denver Parks and Parkway System and other towns throughout Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming. The Radburn, New Jersey superblocks around central park spaces were utilized in the Boulder City plan. In American city planning history, Boulder City was the first fully developed new town during the Community Planning Movement. Named after the dam general superintendent in 1981, the Frank T. Crowe Memorial Park was a large neighborhood park. The civic center of public buildings was the center of a triangular-shaped city plan with the Bureau of Reclamation administration building at the apex. The engineering basic support infrastructure of water, sewer, electricity and roadways was constructed. In 1931, the water for Boulder City came six miles from the Colorado River in a twelve-inch water main pumped up 2,000 feet in elevation. A pre-sedimentation basin, filtration system, water softening, and chlorination were needed. Four pumping stations and five water storage tanks were required.

Through the worst years of the Great Depression as many as five thousand laborers toiled twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to erect the huge structure that would harness the Colorado River and transform the American West. Construction of the giant dam was a triumph of human ingenuity, yet the full story of this monumental endeavor has never been told. Now, in an engrossing, fast-paced narrative, Joseph E. Stevens recounts the gripping saga of Hoover Dam. Drawing on a wealth of material, including manuscript collections, government documents, contemporary newspaper and magazine accounts, and personal interviews and correspondence with men and women who were involved with the construction, he brings the Hoover Dam adventure to life. Described here in dramatic detail are the deadly hazards the work crews faced as they hacked and blasted the dam\u2019s foundation out of solid rock; the bitter political battles and violent labor unrest that threatened to shut the job down; the deprivation and grinding hardship endured by the workers\u2019 families; the dam builders\u2019 gambling, drinking, and whoring sprees in nearby Las Vegas; and the stirring triumphs and searing moments of terror as the massive concrete wedge rose inexorably from the canyon floor.

In this study, height, body mass (BM), body fat percentage (BF%) using skinfold measurements, and several predicted 1 repetition maximal strength and power measures in 30 returning players from the 2011 NYG team, who recently won the Super Bowl, were collected. Players were grouped by position: running back, quarterback (QB), wide receiver (WR), tight end, offensive lineman (OL), defensive lineman (DL), linebacker (LB), and defensive back (DB). Pooled and weighted mean differences (NYG - NFL) and effect sizes were used to evaluate height, BM, and BF% comparisons of NYG to previous NFL studies from 1998 to 2009. The characteristics of the players as a group were: age, height, BM, BF%: 26 +/- 2 years, 183.8 +/- 9.0 cm, 144.9 +/- 20.8 kg, 14.3 +/- 5.5%, respectively. Comparisons highlight distinct position-specific dissimilarity in strength measures, BM, and BF%, which reflect current strength training, conditioning, and team play strategy. As expected, NYG positional differences were found for height (p 0.05), BM (p 0.037), BF% (p 0.048), bench press (p 0.048), inclined bench press (p 0.013), and squat (p 0.026). Anthropometrics profiles did not significantly differ from previously published trends in NFL players indicating equity in physical characteristics over the past 13 years. However, NYG LBs, DLs, OLs, QBs, and WRs trended toward less BF% but generally similar BM compared with NFL players, suggesting greater lean BM in these positions.

There are now as many different, technologically enhanced contexts for watching the Olympics as there are social subjectivities of Olympic viewers. This relationship between space and sociality is important in analyzing the collective cultural significance of the Games and the mythologies and ideologies that they can promote and disseminate. In the heavily charged atmosphere of the millennial Games in a postcolonial, Southern Hemisphere nation about to celebrate its centenary, yet still struggling to reconcile with its indigenous peoples (Godwell 2000), the Olympics provided a probably unprecedented forum for appraising and assessing contemporary \"Australianness.\"1 At the Summer 2000 Olympics in Sydney-hailed at the closing ceremony by outgoing IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch as the \"best Games ever\"-the positioning of Aboriginal champion Cathy Freeman at the opening ceremony and her gold medal-winning performance on the track were symbolic highlights for the host city and nation. The opening ceremony emphasized the theme of reconciliation related to the history of first the colony's and then the nation's treatment of Aboriginal peoples. The choice of Freeman, a participating athlete, to light the Olympic flame was a climax to the theme of reconciliation (Rowe 2000a). She also had run the stadium lap of the torch relay with other celebrated Australian women athletes, thus representing the inclusiveness of the contemporary Olympic ideal on several levels. The Aboriginal theme had been prominent in the Sydney Olympic bid and in the arts and cultural festivals held during the Sydney Olympiad (Stevenson 19 1998).2 It remained prominent throughout the Olympic event itself, especially in Freeman's two starring moments, lighting the Olympic flame and taking the gold medal in the women's 400-meters athletics event. In this chapter, these Olympic Games are analyzed from the hermeneutical vantage points of the spectators in the stadium and in various sites across the Australian nation.Our case study, the \"Freeman Final,\" as we shall describe it, provided a key link between these dispersed viewing sites, thus symbolically uniting a rather less-than-united nation. The analysis will show how the media relay and transform events that can be reduced to neither embodied experience nor their representation. This study will highlight the complex relationship between audience, text, and context, questioning the still-dominant binary analytical model of \"being there\"/\"viewing from a distance.\" Despite the rather porous nature of this binary framework, it will nonetheless be shown that physical co-presence remains a key form of scarce cultural capital for those attending mega-media sports events, the stadium's combination of society and space providing authority over collective memory. \u00a9 2006 State University of New York.

This upturn is observed to a different extent among all age groups and with a lesser effect among normally menstruating women. During the years 1950 to 1970, the epidemic proportions could hardly be overlooked. Since 1970, the increase has been more gradual, and since 1975 coronary deaths have plateaued. A reduction in the prevalence of coronary disease deaths could possibly have occurred for men ages 40-45. Also, the number of fatal strokes has decreased in the FRG for the last 3 reporting years. Clinical and pathoanatomical investigations in Germany prove that coronary heart disease deaths between 1945 and 1948 were rare-a paucity of global statistics precludes adequate comparison with other countries. These data are supported by the study of the pathoanatomical protocols showing very few cases of accluding coronary sclerosis. Comparative pathoanatomical studies conducted for the years 1939-1953 in Basel and Marburg and ranked according to progression disclosed no significant differences in atherosclerotic disorders. Yet, autopsy reports of the University of Marburg for the years 1945-1948 indicate an increased prevalence of premature fatty streaks and edema. This probably could be due to higher numbers of critically injured and chronically ill soldiers. In another Swiss study, a substantial increase of coronary atherosclerosis was found among active duty soldiers in 1939-1945 and 50 accident deaths examined at the Z??rich Institute of Pathology in 1964. This process can be related to the nutritional situation of the 60s as opposed to the war years. The less dramatic reduction of calorie intake in neutral Switzerland should be considered when compared with European countries at war. Thromboembolism in the FRG was considerably lower during the lean postwar years than during the prewar years and the years following 1948. Perhaps the only benefit resulting from the World War II years was that they contributed to our understanding of the roles of nutrition, smoking, obesity and physical activity in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis. ?? 1979.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0018633140", "issn": "00917435", "doi": "10.1016/0091-7435(79)90336-0"}, "source": "Preventive Medicine", "authors": [{"first_name": "G.", "last_name": "Schettler"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/cardiovascular-diseases-during-after-world-war-ii-comparison-federal-republic-germany-other-european", "year": 1979, "type": "journal", "id": "3a3478ab-7b69-3dea-996e-3cbdacd34c83"}, {"title": "The European Union and its Member States: An Overview", "abstract": "The European Union, like other international institutuions, is composed of a set of member states.

At the same time the group is convinced that there is much value in mutual learning between Member States and that exiting evidence about innovative approaches to social protection against long-term care risks demonstrate that it is possible to contain the growth in needs , make care more efficient and ensure dignity in care if action is taken based on best available knowledge. Several different approaches may have to be taken at the same time and with different emphasis in different Member States.\\r\\nThe aim of this report is:\\r\\n\u2022 to reiterate the case for social protection against the risk of LTC needs;\\r\\n\u2022 to identify existing evidence about possible ways to contain and address present and future demands;\\r\\n\u2022 to identify where there is lack of knowledge and need for further evidence;\\r\\n\u2022 to give examples of good practices around the EU that could be considered also in other Member States;\\r\\n\u2022 to suggest to the SPC where policy action could be taken to increase EU support to the efforts of Member States.\\r\\nThe aim of this report is not:\\r\\n\u2022 to change the primary responsibility of Member States for the provision of LTC;\\r\\n\u2022 to increase the burden of reporting on Member States.\\r\\nAs a basis for the report the SPC-WG-AGE has used knowledge gained during a number of meetings where experts and stakeholders from a wide range of Member States and organisations have presented their view and expertise.

Verdi, Uncle Tom and the unification of Italy", "abstract": "This article explores Italian images of America during the Risorgimento and the time of Italy's unification. At the centre of this investigation are two remarkably painful theatrical representations of life in the New World: Verdi's 1859 opera Un ballo in maschera, set in seventeenth-century Boston; and Rota's 1852 ballet Bianchi e neri, based on Harriet Beecher Stowe's epic novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Often performed together during the same evening, both works presented Italians with an extremely disturbing image of America, a negation of Italy's own cultural values. The article reads these theatrical representations of America within a wider context of Italian debates on the United States. Italians did not always look at life in America as a political, social or constitutional model; and if in the eyes of many Italians the United States became an epitome of modernity later in the nineteenth century, they did not necessarily identify with the particular model of modernity America stood for.

Determination of the characteristic chemical composition of each grade will strengthen the existing basic knowledge of maple syrup chemistry and potentially provide a tool which can be used in the detection of syrup adultered by artificial decolorization.

It was suspected that a source of DP to the environment might be its manufacturing facility located in the city of Niagara Falls, New York. To confirm this source location and to determine DP's spatial distribution, 26 tree bark samples were collected in triplicate from the northeastern United States, and the concentrations of DP and several brominated flame retardants (BFRs) were measured. Most concentrations of DP in tree bark were found to be much higher than those of the BFRs. The highest DP concentrations were >100 ng g(-1) bark in the city of Niagara Falls, dropping rapidly with distance from the potential source. A simple one-dimensional, Gaussian diffusion model was used to explain the spatial distribution of DP and to locate the source.

Here a simple biologically and physically-based model of sapflow potential is used to assess observed changes in sapflow across the Northeastern US from 1980 to 2006; document the correspondence between these observations and independent downscaled atmosphere ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) simulations of conditions during this period; and quantify changes in sapflow potential through 2100. The sapflow model is able to capture the spatial and temporal (in terms of the start date of sapflow) variations of sapflow that are observed across the Northeast. Likewise the AOGCM simulations reflect the mean number of sapflow days and the timing of sapflow during the 1980-2006 overlap period. Through the twenty-first century, warming winter temperatures will result in a decline in the number of sapflow days if traditional sap collection schedules are maintained. Under the A1fi emissions scenario the number of sapflow days decreases by up to 14 days. However, the changes in climate also translate the optimal timing of sap collection to earlier in the year. Across the region, the time period that maximizes the number of sapflows days becomes as much as 30 days earlier by 2100 under the A1fi emissions scenario. Provided this change is accounted for by modifying the start of the traditional sap collection schedule, there is essentially no net loss of sapflow days across the majority of the region, with a net increase of sapflow days indicated in the extreme north.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-77953024705", "issn": "01650009", "isbn": "0165-0009", "doi": "10.1007/s10584-009-9685-0"}, "source": "Climatic Change", "authors": [{"first_name": "Christopher B.", "last_name": "Skinner"}, {"first_name": "Arthur T.", "last_name": "DeGaetano"}, {"first_name": "Brian F.", "last_name": "Chabot"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/implications-twentyfirst-century-climate-change-northeastern-united-states-maple-syrup-production-im", "year": 2010, "type": "journal", "id": "1ff50c96-899f-35ff-87f5-2b10fc4c2a2b"}, {"title": "United States Department of Agriculture", "abstract": "World demand for U.S. agricultural crops and products strengthened last year as U.S. exports outpaced U.S. imports.

Although disinhibited RAD is most commonly observed in institutionalised children, similar behaviours may also be a part of the emotional difficulties displayed by some fostered and adopted children (the latter includes those once institutionalised), and these may demonstrate not so much a discrete attachment disorder as either the need to fend for oneself following loss of dedicated caregiving or a lack of opportunity to build specific intimate relationships with dedicated caregivers. In many cases this may be inextricably mixed with the neurobiological and psychological seqelae of maltreatment. Indiscriminate attachment behaviour, from this proposed evolutionary perspective, is less a syndrome of mental ill-health than an astute survival manoeuvre following being orphaned, abandoned or fecklessly reared. Such a response, allied to the innate facility to access caregiving from different adults, could be expected to be initiated by specific events as are the other attachment configurations.

Its etiology is hypothesized as related to failure of attachment beginning in infancy. Although the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is usually made in early childhood, the diagnosis may be carried over into adolescence. In some cases, the diagnosis may be made for the first time in adolescence if there is sufficient information in the history to make the diagnosis retrospectively. It is unlikely that the diagnosis of RAD can be made in the absence of comorbid diagnoses in adolescence because these children usually have symptoms which meet the criteria for other diagnoses, such as attention deficit disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), mood disorder, or conduct disorder (CD) by the time they become early or mid-adolescent ages. During development, additional diagnostic criteria for other DSM-IV diagnoses may be observed. Although a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, ODD, and/or CD might appear to take precedence over RAD, with the burgeoning information in genetics it may be useful to know that RAD was present or may still be present in the symptom complex of an individual patient.

They are also responsible for a great deal of the world\u2019s linguistic and cultural diversity, and their traditional knowledge has been and continues to be an invaluable resource that benefits all of mankind. Yet, indigenous peoples continue to suffer discrimination, marginalization, extreme poverty and conflict. Some are being dispossessed of their traditional lands as their livelihoods are being undermined. Meanwhile, their belief systems, cultures, languages and ways of life continue to be threatened, sometimes even by extinction. Increasingly, governments are recognizing these threats, and matching such recognition with action. From land claims settlements and constitutional amendments to important symbolic actions such as apologies for past treatment of indigenous peoples, governments around the world are making important steps towards addressing indigenous peoples\u2019 concerns. In responding to the challenges they continue to face, indigenous peoples have engaged the international community, calling for a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and a permanent forum at the United Nations that meets regularly to discuss indigenous peoples\u2019 issues and make recommendations to the UN system and beyond. The United Nations has committed its unwavering support to a future where all indigenous peoples will enjoy peace, human rights and well-being, and has responded to indigenous peoples\u2019 demands, welcoming them as partners. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted in September 2007, and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues meets annually at UN Headquarters, bringing together indigenous peoples, Member States, NGOs, UN agencies and other intergovernmental organizations. Much work remains to be done in advancing the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. One condition for facilitating the implementation of the Declaration is information about the state of the world\u2019s indigenous peoples. The Permanent Forum recognized this in its first session when it recommended that the United Nations system produce a publication \u201con the state of the world\u2019s indigenous peoples, containing data on indigenous peoples and discussing issues relating to indigenous peoples in the thematic areas within the Forum\u2019s mandate.\u201d1 Responding to this request, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs reached out to experts on indigenous issues who have contributed the material for this publication. The chapters are based on the thematic areas within the Permanent Forum\u2019s mandate, and highlight some major issues indigenous peoples face.

According to transaction cost economics (Williamson, 1975) high uncertainty, high asset specificity, situated knowledge and the high frequency of transactions associated with megaprojects should drive managers to internalise resources. However, evidence from case studies reveals the following paradox: managerial incentives to invest in internal resources through vertical integration are limited because of fixed time horizons; yet, the alternative of outsourcing and contract management through the market mechanism escalates transaction costs. This research therefore seeks to identify how practitioners might improve performance through more efficient engagement with each other and overcome the technical, psychological and political barriers uncounted in the delivery of megaprojects (Flyvbjerg, 2006). This study also identifies the extent to which the transaction costs approach applies to temporary governance structures such as mega-projects. At this stage, this paper is mainly theoretical and seeks to provide a conceptual framework for the understanding of megaprojects, as governance structures.

Intentional maritime voyaging appears to have developed sometime after about 75,000 years ago, contributing to some of the most important migrations in human history, including the peopling of Australia, western Melanesia, and the Pacific Islands.  Evidence for Pleistocene seafaring in Southeast Asia and Australia - along with recent archaeological paleoecological evidence from both North and South Ameria - has helped revive the notion that the Americas also may have been settled by maritime peoples.  Evidence that Pleistocene voyaging contributed to the initial colonization of the New World is still largely circumstantial, but a variety of data susgest that it is increasingly likely that such a maritime migration took place.

Now generally believed to be descended from the wolf (Canis lupus), some biologists point directly at the Asian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes and Canis lupus arabs). Until relatively recently the domesticated dog was thought to be the result of the cross breeding of various canids, including the wolf, the jackal (Canis aureus) and perhaps the coyote (Canis latrans). The possibility of any jackal ancestry subsequently ruled out it was classified as Canis familiaris. Given that the dog and the wolf are able to interbreed and produce viable fertile offspring, something not previously thought possible in higher mammals across species, the domesticated dog is currently considered a subspecies of the wolf being placed in the genus lupus, along with the wolf, and is now sometimes classified as Canis lupus familiaris. However, the DNA studied of ancient American dogs appears to show greater similarities with the Eurasian dog than with the north American wolf. After the examining of mitochondrial (mt) DNA of some 654 dogs from around the world, biologists hold that a commonality can be demonstrated between regional groups of dogs, implying a common parent or group of parents. The mtDNA varies little from dog to dog regardless of its location or breed, much as is the case with humans. Early Native Americans are thought to have brought dogs with them from Asia as the Aboriginals of Australia likewise are believed to have imported the dingo (Canis dingo). Despite some opinion that dogs were domesticated independently in the Old World and in the New, most consider domestication to have happened only once, possibly around 15,000 years ago in Asia. I propose that dogs were pre- 1 domesticated either from wolves and/or wild dogs independently in different places and different times without human intervention and that subsequent hybridization of wolves and dogs in addition to cross breeding within a species both by, and without man, has occurred which completed the domestication process. I point further to the possible movement of man and dog between the Eurasian and American continents prior to, and during the exposure of the Bering land mass and after its last submergence.", "authors": [{"first_name": "Dominic", "last_name": "Eckersley"}, {"first_name": "New York", "last_name": "City"}], "source": "New York", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/thyroxines-role-predomestication-dog-wild-dogs-wolves-unique-opportunity-reexamine-mans-dogs-migrati", "year": 2003, "type": "report", "id": "34b5bfda-288e-3a0a-9a4f-d750158b6ba6"}, {"title": "Crime & Criminal Justice in New York City, 1981", "abstract": "Although final figures are not available, it appears that the number of serious crimes recorded in 1981 will be only slightly greater than in 1980. Primary credit for holding the line against crime belongs to the New York City Police Department. The department faced the greatest volume of crime ever, with the smallest complement of personnel in over 25 years. In courts and corrections, 1981 witnessed little progress and major failures. For example, the State corrections commissioner was caught between a Federal court order to accept more prisoners in facilities already at 112-percent capacity and a State court directive forbidding further overcrowding. The period from May through September 1981 witnessed a decline in total Index crimes; 311,1973 crimes were recorded in 1981 compared with 321,105 for 1980. This decline is attributable to police department efforts targeting robbery and the career criminal. Problem areas which remain in the enforcement area include police personnel reduction, command structure, and development of effective control strategies for subway crime. Leading authorities have urged more certainty in sentencing for years, but by 1981 this consistency had not been achieved. Reforms are also recommended in the areas of jury selection, bail, and the juvenile court.

Hong Kong's population consists of about 98% ethnic Chinese and 2% other ethnic groups, mostly European.  Only 57.2% of the population were born in Hong Kong.  Cantonese is the Chinese dialect spoken by most of the territory's population, but English is widely understood.  Not until after 1949 did Hong Kong develop into a leading manufacturing, commercial, and tourist center.  Hong Kong's foreign relations are the responsibility of the British government, but considerable autonomy has been permitted in the area of commercial relations.  Following the June 30, 1997, expiration date of the lease on the New Territories, which comprise 92% of Hong Kong's total area, Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region of China in 1997.  Hong Kong has little arable land and virtually no natural resources.  The colony always has depended on foreign trade.  Hong Kong has developed into a center of light manufacturing and international finance.  In 1984, Hong Kong's foreign trade was valued at $57 billion.  Hong Kongs economy has recovered strongly from the 1981-82 recession.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "12178122", "issn": "10495517", "isbn": "9789622099029"}, "source": "Department of State publication.

Larry \u201cblow up the World Trade Center for Israel\u201d Silverstein is light-years beyond Adler. Larry Silverstein, you may recall, is a reputed mobster who allegedly got his start in the sex services business and then oozed into real estate. Two months before 9/11, Silverstein finalized his 100-year-lease on the white elephant, condemned-for-asbestos World Trade Center complex \u2013 and proceeded to double the insurance and hardball his insurers into changing the policy to \u201ccash payout.\u201d On 9/11/01, Silverstein skipped his usual breakfast at the top of the North Tower. He says his wife reminded him of an appointment with his dermatologist. Other family members also stayed away, with other excuses. All of those who breakfasted there died. Silverstein and family survived. After confessing on national television to blowing up World Trade Center 7, Silverstein went to court and asked for \u2013 and received \u2013 double indemnity, including almost a billion dollars for WTC-7 \u2013 the very building he had confessed to blowing up. Larry had the chutzpah to claim that there were two separate, unrelated terrorist attacks (the two planes) so he should get twice the money. Somehow that worked, presumably thanks to a mobbed-up judge. \u201cLucky Larry\u201d walked away with more than five billion dollars, plus rights to rebuild. But that wasn\u2019t enough chutzpah for Larry. For the past several years he\u2019s been back in court, asking for 11 billion dollars from the airlines\u2019 insurers. Now Silverstein has somehow convinced AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, to give him a special dispensation. Even though AMR has filed bankruptcy, which theoretically should stop all lawsuits against it, the company\u2019s attorneys have \u2013 for unstated reasons \u2013 chosen to insert a special rider into their bankruptcy agreement which allows Silverstein to continue suing the company.

Two WTC, though hit by the second hijacked plane after One WTC, fell first \"primarily\" because the plane struck it at an off-center angle and caused damage that compromised the corner of the core of the building, concludes the report's authors, a team of engineers from several firms working for Silverstein Properties Inc., the New York City-based leaseholder of the World Trade Center. The findings are based on analysis of original structural drawings, thousands of photos and dozens of videos, says Silverstein. The team used computer modeling, some programs developed for the Dept. of Defense, and fire evaluation techniques to simulate the condition of each tower at critical points from impact to collapse. Click here to view diagram 1 Click here to view diagram 2 The team determined that the initial hits destroyed 33 of 59 perimeter columns in the north face of One WTC and 29 of 59 perimeter columns in the south face of Two WTC. Computer analysis showed that the impact of the planes also destroyed or disabled some 20 of 47 columns in the center of the core of One WTC and some five of 47 columns in the southeast corner of the core of Two WTC. The crashes stripped fireproofing from columns in the path of debris created by the planes penetrating the buildings, it continues. One frame from the computer model of the initiation of the collapse of Tower 2 performed by Weidlinger Associates The team says the towers' columns of the redundant exterior tube and core columns, connected by a steel \"hat truss\" at the top of the buildings, redistributed loads away from the damaged areas to remaining columns. This allowed the towers to stand as long as they did, says the report. In a release, Matthys Levy of Weidlinger Associates Inc., one of the engineers on the study team, states, \"The fact that tower one stood for 103 minutes.... and tower two for 56 minutes\" after the loss of so many columns, \"is a testament to the strength of the buildings and the skill of Leslie Robertson and the other engineers who designed them. I believe that few, if any, other buildings could suffer that amount of damage and not collapse immediately.\" The computer models, says the report, identify the failure of columns that either lost fireproofing or were destroyed on impact as the specific cause of the collapse of each tower. \"No fireproofing is designed to withstand such devastating impacts,\" says the report. It adds that the fireproofing on the structural elements of the towers had been inspected regularly and that the inspection program \"represented a greater standard of care than is generally followed for high-rise office buildings in New York City.\" The report exonerates the floor trusses for the collapses. \"Failure of the floors...was shown not to have had any significant role in the initiation of the collapses,\" it says. Studies by Hughes Associates and ARUPFire led the team to conclude that tower floors survived the initial impact of the planes, suffering only localized damage. On the basis of a review of smoke plumes and fire spread, for each tower, the engineers concluded that the fires did not lead to the collapses of the floors affected before the towers fell. Additionally, the engineers claim that computer modeling shows that the failure of columns alone, independent of the floors explains the collapses. Diagram illustrating the way Tower 1 redistributed loads to other columns on its north face and started off immediate collapse, as modeled by Weidlinger Associates The findings are intended to build on the study initiated by the American Society of Civil Engineers and sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, called World Trade Center Building Performance Study. Released last May, it suggested subjecting the floor truss system to \"more detailed evaluation.\" But the study also stated the truss systems \"should not be regarded\" as design deficiencies, says the Silverstein report. The Silverstein report also concludes that fire temperatures were lower than typical \"fully developed\" office fires. The fires were fueled by office furniture and floor contents initially ignited by the jet fuel, which burned out quickly. Dust and debris distributed by the crashes inhibited the fires, which at the impact floors were between 750\u00b0F and 1,300\u00b0F.

Most of the research reviewed was conducted with people not known to be suffering from any disorder. It is concluded that research on the effects of diet on the mood and performance has produced an interesting mix of results. Tryptophan administration either by intravenous injection or oral consumption reliably increases feelings of drowsiness and lethargy but seems to have little, if any, effect on performance. Tryptophan depletion seems to reliably increase feelings of depression, although not to clinical levels. Whereas tryptophan reliably alters mood, tyrosine seems to do so only when an individual is placed in a situation in which the catecholaminergic neurons are active. Aspartame does not have a mood-altering effect, although many individuals have attributed their physical and psychological symptoms to consumption of this sweetener. Most studies have demonstrated that consumption of a carbohydrate-rich meal has little, if any, effect on mood, probably because a carbohydrate-rich meal does not alter the plasma tryptophan/LNAA ratio sufficiently to increase the synthesis of central serotonin.

Between 01/01/1997 and 09/11/2002, 31,994 spirometries were obtained and the FEV(1) and FVC were analyzed for differences according to estimated World Trade Center exposure intensity. Adjusted average FEV(1) during the first year after 09/11/2001 was compared with the 5 yr before 09/11/2001. Median time between 09/11/2001 and a worker's first spirometry afterwards was 3 mo; 90% were assessed within 5 mo.\\n\\nMAIN RESULTS: World Trade Center-exposed workers experienced a substantial reduction in adjusted average FEV(1) during the year after 09/11/2001 (372 ml; 95% confidence interval, 364-381 ml; p < 0.001) This exposure-related FEV(1) decrement equaled 12 yr of aging-related FEV(1) decline. Moreover, exposure intensity assessed by initial arrival time at the World Trade Center site correlated linearly with FEV(1) reduction in an exposure intensity-response gradient (p = 0.048). Respiratory symptoms also predicted a further FEV(1) decrease (p < 0.001).

To address this concern, NYCDOHMH quickly implemented a syndromic surveillance system in hospital emergency departments (EDs) to identify a large-scale bioterrorist event and other health conditions related to the WTC attacks.

From 1917 the rise of labour agitation and the radicalization of Catalan nationalism precipitated the formation of a counter-revolutionary coalition between the armed forces and right-wing sectors of Catalan society. Along with the military, the coalition took in, on the one hand, the territory's business, Catholic, Monarchist and regionalist organizations, and on the other, some working-class elements integrated within the Sindicatos Libres. The former championed what we have termed the 'Catalan road' to authoritarianism, calling for the construction of independent Catalan institutions in order to deal with the threat of subversion. However, the coalition proved unstable. Divisions opened up between conservative rightists and the radical rightists of the Sindicatos Libres. Moreover, once Primo de Rivera came to power he reneged on his regionalist pronouncements and put in place a centralizing regime.

En un sentit ampli, la Dictadura representa un intent de posada al dia de les relacions existents entre les diferents fraccions de la classe dominant: la gran propietat territorial i les grans finances, amb l\u2019afegit de la ind\u00fastria pesada, el capital monopolista d\u2019Estat i, en segon pla, el grup industrial i comercial catal\u00e0. Aquestes relacions s\u2019havien de traduir en el predomini d\u2019una estrat\u00e8gia econ\u00f2mico-social determinada i, al mateix temps, en una forma concreta de relaci\u00f3 del bloc dominant amb el poder; relaci\u00f3 que tradicionalment dirigia la gran propietat territorial a trav\u00e9s de la persona del rei, l\u2019utilitzaci\u00f3 del sistema caciquista i la col\u00b7laboraci\u00f3 de les institucions militars i eclesi\u00e0stiques.

De fet, l\u2019excepcionalitat pol\u00edtica \u00e9s un recurs de la classe dominant per procedir a la seva reorganitzaci\u00f3 interna. A m\u00e9s tot sembla indicar que, a m\u00e9s, qui pretenia la reorganitzaci\u00f3 era l\u2019element \u201cmodern\u201d de la coalici\u00f3 dominant.

L\u2019Esgl\u00e9sia no tingu\u00e9 la necessitat d\u2019organitzar el seu partit pol\u00edtic (l\u2019equivalent de l\u2019itali\u00e0 Sturzo el represent\u00e0 Ossorio y Gallardo, A.

Per\u00f2 no oblidar que per sota de la remodelaci\u00f3 del bloc dominant exist\u00ed un intent de recanvi de la classe pol\u00edtica en el poder que s\u2019acordar\u00e0 a aquella remodelaci\u00f3. I aquesta iniciativa necessitava nova estrat\u00e8gia, ideologia, nous mites, etc. El fet va m\u00e9s enll\u00e0 d\u2019un ex\u00e8rcit molt dividit i uns militars.

Per\u00f2 el cert \u00e9s que la Dictadura, tret de moments concrets de mobilitzaci\u00f3 organitzats pel poder, no genera cap moviment d\u2019adhesi\u00f3 de masses com en el cas itali\u00e0. Aquest \u201cneo-caciquisme\u201d afavor\u00ed un cop m\u00e9s el tradicional extrapoliticisme d\u2019amplis sectors.   Perqu\u00e8 el bloc dominant determin\u00e9s anar m\u00e9s enll\u00e0 de retocs improvisats, era necessari que a la situaci\u00f3 de crisi objectiva i subjectiva s\u2019afeg\u00eds una p\u00e8rdua de control en un moment de canvi precipitat, aix\u00ed com l\u2019exist\u00e8ncia d\u2019una alternativa obrera realment revolucion\u00e0ria. A Espanya, la neutralitzaci\u00f3 del socialisme i el desmantellament de la CNT, en bona mesura abans del cop d\u2019Estat i per mediaci\u00f3 de Mart\u00ednez Anido i els Sindicats Lliures, evidencien que no es tractava d\u2019aquest cas.   Desmarat dels casos d\u2019It\u00e0lia i Alemanya, s\u2019assembla m\u00e9s a altres cops de Llatinoam\u00e8rica i Europa del Sud i l\u2019Est. Es podia dir que es deu a la resposta unitarista, regeneracionista (en s\u00edntesi modernitzadora), d\u2019una forma o altra contrarevolucion\u00e0ria, resposta a un jove i deficient funcionament del sistema parlamentari. Per\u00f2 altres motius.   Hi ha elements que sintetitzen aquest per\u00edode d\u2019entreguerres: tensions per la creixent compet\u00e8ncia imperialista i conseq\u00fc\u00e8ncies en l\u2019ordre econ\u00f2mic, pol\u00edtic, social, geogr\u00e0fic, etc. I estrat\u00e8gia general antisovi\u00e8tica i l\u2019acci\u00f3 localitzada contra qualsevol tipus de mobilitzaci\u00f3 popular. I enfonsament d\u2019hegemonies tradicionals, de formes de dominaci\u00f3 a les que circumstancialment s\u2019havia sobreposat un sistema parlamentari que no les afectava en absolut.   Semblances amb pa\u00efsos que no tenen un sector d\u2019ind\u00fastria pesada i financera nacionals i hegem\u00f2nics, com Alemanya i It\u00e0lia. El cas de Rumania, Yugosl\u00e0via, Portugal, Turqu\u00eda, Gr\u00e8cia, Bulg\u00e0ria, Hungria, Pol\u00f2nia.   Es volia contrarrestar: - crisi social amb el terrorisme; \u2013 nacionalismes creixents, sobretot el catal\u00e0; \u2013 el proc\u00e9s de responsabilitats obertes pel desastre d\u2019Annual (1921); - un estat de corrupci\u00f3 i relaxament administratiu; - l\u2019acci\u00f3 considerada escandalosa dels \u201cpol\u00edtics professionals\u201d i la den\u00fancia del carrer\u00f3 sense sortida on havia desembocat el sistema parlamentari; - acci\u00f3 del moviment obrer progressivament agressiu, al qual de forma sistem\u00e0tica es confon amb el terrorisme.   Tamb\u00e9 radicalitzaci\u00f3 de les tensions dins del mateix bloc hegem\u00f2nic. Impacte de la I GM, aparici\u00f3 de nous grups i la mentalitat-actuaci\u00f3 del \u201cnou ric\u201d.    Pes diferent segons grups i sectors de la burgesia, diferent grau de possibilitats que respectivament tenen per influir en les decisions de poder.   Abans del cop es busc\u00e0 la soluci\u00f3 dels conflictes dins la legalitat constitucional. Nom\u00e9s seria la comprovaci\u00f3 que una homogene\u00eftzaci\u00f3 no seria possible sense un control extraordinari i que solsament aquesta nova situaci\u00f3 permetria contrarestar el desgast del poder davant la multiplicitat dels processos de mobilitzaci\u00f3 social, que desembocaria en l\u2019acord t\u00e0cit de recorrer a l\u2019ex\u00e8rcit.   Descartada la crisi econ\u00f2mica com a causa fonamental, conv\u00e9 tornar a l\u2019exemple catal\u00e0. Fou la \u00fanica zona on la burgesia assaj\u00e0, amb limitacions, un proc\u00e9s de modernitzaci\u00f3 i integraci\u00f3 social, un estatisme regional. No obstant, bona part de la inspiraci\u00f3 que desembocaria en el cop d\u2019Estat de 1923 partiria d\u2019aquesta zona i d\u2019aquests nuclis. Proc\u00e9s de gestaci\u00f3 que arranca de finals de 1918. El revelador era la demanda d\u2019una sortida excepcional des de sectors tradicionalment partidaris de les solucions pol\u00edtico-liberals; cas de Camb\u00f3 de cara al conjunt estatal i per Puig i Cadafalch des de la Mancomunitat. Catalunya es convert\u00ed en la zona m\u00e9s sensible al ritme de la crisi econ\u00f2mica i social i a les demandes d\u2019aquesta nova orientaci\u00f3 per\u00f2, en principi, en una perspectiva essencialment estatista, seguint la tradici\u00f3 del catalanisme d\u2019inspiraci\u00f3 pratiana.

OBJECTIVES: To assess fetal exposure to smoking in a representative sample of pregnant women and its trends. METHODS: The prevalence of smoking and smoking cessation were analyzed in a representative sample of women who gave birth in the city of Barcelona, extracted from a population-based registry of birth defects. The sample consisted of 1,801 women and covered the period 1994 to 2001. RESULTS: Among pregnant women, 43.4 % smoked before pregnancy, and 42.2 % of these quit. At the time of giving birth, 25.2 % of the women were smokers. Over the period studied the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women clearly decreased. Although the proportion of cessations showed no significant changes, fetal exposure to tobacco decreased.

Skipping breakfast has been associated with overweight. This study aimed to describe overweight and obesity among high school students in Barcelona and to analyze their association with eating habits and sedentary behaviors.\\n\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 2008 on a representative sample of high-school students in Barcelona (Spain). Overweight and obesity were defined using Body Mass Index (BMI), which was calculated from objective measurements. The prevalences of overweight and obesity were determined, and their association with eating habits, sedentary behaviors, and physical activity was analyzed using logistic regression models.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 3,089 students were analyzed (52% girls). The prevalence of overweight was 26.1% in boys (6.2% obese) and 20.6% in girls (3.7% obese). In both sexes, overweight was associated with being younger, having breakfast less often, being on a diet, and with a lower frequency of unhealthy food intake. Being on a diet and a lower unhealthy food intake were related to obesity in both sexes. Among boys, obesity was also associated with sedentary behaviors.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The results show that overweight and obesity are a serious public health problem and confirm the importance of breakfast to prevent overweight.

To examine the profile and referral pattern of patients attending an out-patient pain management service in Hong Kong. Design. Prospective cross-sectional survey. Setting.

Main outcome measures. Demographic profiles, referring specialty, pain diagnosis, pain sites, duration and severity of pain, treatment modality, litigation, compensation, and social welfare status. Data were collected using a standardised questionnaire. Results. Two hundred and forty-eight patients were interviewed. Most patients (70%) were middle-aged, with 21% over 60 years. Seventy-nine percent of patients were referred to the clinics either from orthopaedic surgeons (64.1%), general and other surgeons (14.9%), or general practitioners (3.6%). The median (range) duration of pain was 2.3 (0.08-26.7) years. The most common pain diagnoses were musculoskeletal back pain (46.4%) and neuropathic pain (27.8%). A total of 11.3% of the patients had two pain diagnoses, while 40.7% complained of pain in more than one location. Pain in the limbs was the most frequent complaint followed by the head, neck, and back. Approximately 38% of patients had tried four or more treatment modalities. Oral medication was the most common method (86.7%) of pain-relief treatment. More than half of the patients had also tried physiotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine. Approximately 37% of the patients were unemployed, while 31% were receiving social security subsidy. Eighty-six patients had pain associated with a work-related injury, and of these patients, 80% were involved in compensation claims. Conclusions. The profile of patients referred to the pain management clinics was complex. Patients were mainly referred from specialists.

ASDs typically are apparent before age 3 years, with associated impairments affecting multiple areas of a person's life. Because no biologic marker exists for ASDs, identification is made by professionals who evaluate a child's developmental progress to identify the presence of developmental disorders.\\n\\nREPORTING PERIOD: 2006.\\n\\nMETHODS: Earlier surveillance efforts indicated that age 8 years is a reasonable index age at which to monitor peak prevalence. The identified prevalence of ASDs in U.S. children aged 8 years was estimated through a systematic retrospective review of evaluation records in multiple sites participating in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. Data were collected from existing records in 11 ADDM Network sites (areas of Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wisconsin) for 2006. To analyze changes in identified ASD prevalence, CDC compared the 2006 data with data collected from 10 sites (all sites noted above except Florida) in 2002. Children aged 8 years with a notation of an ASD or descriptions consistent with an ASD were identified through screening and abstraction of existing health and education records containing professional assessments of the child's developmental progress at health-care or education facilities. Children aged 8 years whose parent(s) or legal guardian(s) resided in the respective areas in 2006 met the case definition for an ASD if their records documented behaviors consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder--not otherwise specified (PDD NOS), or Asperger disorder. Presence of an identified ASD was determined through a review of data abstracted from developmental evaluation records by trained clinician reviewers.\\n\\nRESULTS: For the 2006 surveillance year, 2,757 (0.9%) of 308,038 [corrected] children aged 8 years residing in the 11 ADDM sites were identified as having an ASD, indicating an overall average prevalence of 9.0 per 1,000 population (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.6--9.3). ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years ranged from 4.2 in Florida to 12.1 in Arizona and Missouri, with prevalence for the majority of sites ranging between 7.6 and 10.4. For 2006, ASD prevalence was significantly lower in Florida (p<0.001) and Alabama (p<0.05) and higher in Arizona and Missouri (p<0.05) than in all other sites. The ratio of males to females ranged from 3.2:1 in Alabama to 7.6:1 in Florida. ASD prevalence varied by type of ascertainment source, with higher average prevalence in sites with access to health and education records (10.0) compared with sites with health records only (7.5). Although parental or professional concerns regarding development before age 36 months were noted in the evaluation records of the majority of children who were identified as having an ASD, the median age of earliest documented ASD diagnosis was much later (range: 41 months [Florida]-60 months [Colorado]). Of 10 sites that collected data for both the 2002 and 2006 surveillance years, nine observed an increase in ASD prevalence (range: 27%-95% increase; p<0.01), with increases among males in all sites and among females in four of 11 sites, and variation among other subgroups.\\n\\nINTERPRETATION: In 2006, on average, approximately 1% or one child in every 110 in the 11 ADDM sites was classified as having an ASD (approximate range: 1:80-1:240 children [males: 1:70; females: 1:315]). The average prevalence of ASDs identified among children aged 8 years increased 57% in 10 sites from the 2002 to the 2006 ADDM surveillance year. Although improved ascertainment accounts for some of the prevalence increases documented in the ADDM sites, a true increase in the risk for children to develop ASD symptoms cannot be ruled out. On average, although delays in identification persisted, ASDs were being diagnosed by community professionals at earlier ages in 2006 than in 2002.\\n\\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: These results indicate an increased prevalence of identified ASDs among U.S. children aged 8 years and underscore the need to regard ASDs as an urgent public health concern. Continued monitoring is needed to document and understand changes over time, including the multiple ascertainment and potential risk factors likely to be contributing. Research is needed to ascertain the factors that put certain persons at risk, and concerted efforts are essential to provide support for persons with ASDs, their families, and communities to improve long-term outcome.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "20023608", "issn": "1545-8636", "isbn": "4044983860"}, "source": "Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

Because no biologic marker exists for ASDs, identification is made by professionals who evaluate a child's developmental progress to identify the presence of developmental disorders.\\n\\nREPORTING PERIOD: 2006.\\n\\nMETHODS: Earlier surveillance efforts indicated that age 8 years is a reasonable index age at which to monitor peak prevalence. The identified prevalence of ASDs in U.S. children aged 8 years was estimated through a systematic retrospective review of evaluation records in multiple sites participating in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. Data were collected from existing records in 11 ADDM Network sites (areas of Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wisconsin) for 2006. To analyze changes in identified ASD prevalence, CDC compared the 2006 data with data collected from 10 sites (all sites noted above except Florida) in 2002. Children aged 8 years with a notation of an ASD or descriptions consistent with an ASD were identified through screening and abstraction of existing health and education records containing professional assessments of the child's developmental progress at health-care or education facilities. Children aged 8 years whose parent(s) or legal guardian(s) resided in the respective areas in 2006 met the case definition for an ASD if their records documented behaviors consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder--not otherwise specified (PDD NOS), or Asperger disorder. Presence of an identified ASD was determined through a review of data abstracted from developmental evaluation records by trained clinician reviewers.\\n\\nRESULTS: For the 2006 surveillance year, 2,757 (0.9%) of 308,038 [corrected] children aged 8 years residing in the 11 ADDM sites were identified as having an ASD, indicating an overall average prevalence of 9.0 per 1,000 population (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.6--9.3). ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years ranged from 4.2 in Florida to 12.1 in Arizona and Missouri, with prevalence for the majority of sites ranging between 7.6 and 10.4. For 2006, ASD prevalence was significantly lower in Florida (p<0.001) and Alabama (p<0.05) and higher in Arizona and Missouri (p<0.05) than in all other sites. The ratio of males to females ranged from 3.2:1 in Alabama to 7.6:1 in Florida. ASD prevalence varied by type of ascertainment source, with higher average prevalence in sites with access to health and education records (10.0) compared with sites with health records only (7.5). Although parental or professional concerns regarding development before age 36 months were noted in the evaluation records of the majority of children who were identified as having an ASD, the median age of earliest documented ASD diagnosis was much later (range: 41 months [Florida]-60 months [Colorado]). Of 10 sites that collected data for both the 2002 and 2006 surveillance years, nine observed an increase in ASD prevalence (range: 27%-95% increase; p<0.01), with increases among males in all sites and among females in four of 11 sites, and variation among other subgroups.\\n\\nINTERPRETATION: In 2006, on average, approximately 1% or one child in every 110 in the 11 ADDM sites was classified as having an ASD (approximate range: 1:80-1:240 children [males: 1:70; females: 1:315]). The average prevalence of ASDs identified among children aged 8 years increased 57% in 10 sites from the 2002 to the 2006 ADDM surveillance year. Although improved ascertainment accounts for some of the prevalence increases documented in the ADDM sites, a true increase in the risk for children to develop ASD symptoms cannot be ruled out. On average, although delays in identification persisted, ASDs were being diagnosed by community professionals at earlier ages in 2006 than in 2002.\\n\\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: These results indicate an increased prevalence of identified ASDs among U.S. children aged 8 years and underscore the need to regard ASDs as an urgent public health concern. Continued monitoring is needed to document and understand changes over time, including the multiple ascertainment and potential risk factors likely to be contributing. Research is needed to ascertain the factors that put certain persons at risk, and concerted efforts are essential to provide support for persons with ASDs, their families, and communities to improve long-term outcome.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "20023608", "issn": "1545-8636", "isbn": "4044983860"}, "source": "Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

Reporting Period Covered: September 2010\u2013December 2011. Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results from the 2011 national survey, 43 state surveys, and 21 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9\u201312. Results: Results from the 2011 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10\u201324 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 32.8% of high school students nationwide had texted or e-mailed while driving, 38.7% had drunk alcohol, and 23.1% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 32.8% of students had been in a physical fight, 20.1% had ever been bullied on school property, and 7.8% had attempted suicide. Many high school students nationwide are engaged in sexual risk behaviors associated with unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection. Nearly half (47.4%) of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 33.7% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 15.3% had had sexual intercourse with four or more people during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 60.2% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2011 national YRBS also indicate many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among adults aged \u226525 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 18.1% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 7.7% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 4.8% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100% fruit juices and 5.7% had not eaten vegetables. Nearly one-third (31.1%) had played video or computer games for 3 or more hours on an average school day. Interpretation: Since 1991, the prevalence of many priority health-risk behaviors among high school students nationwide has decreased. However, many high school students continue to engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Variations were observed in many health-risk behaviors by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade. The prevalence of some health-risk behaviors varied substantially among states and large urban school districts. Public Health Action: YRBS data are used to measure progress toward achieving 20 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; to assess trends in priority health-risk behaviors among high school students; and to evaluate the impact of broad school and community interventions at the national, state, and local levels.

The Express, in an editorial on the prince\u2019s adventures in Las Vegas, concludes: \u2018Good luck to him.\u2019 A Mirror writer observes: \u2018. . . these pictures have just made me like him even more.\u2019 The Sun\u2019s leader carried a headline making a joke out of the prince\u2019s game of strip billiards: \u2018Cue laughter.\u2019 But the Mail is at Defcon 1 on the indignation scale, devoting its first five pages to the story and leading with the headline \u2018Palace fury at Harry naked Photos\u2019. There is a \u2018firestorm\u2019 about the pictures, the paper declared in paragraph one, though it seemed to have some difficulty locating this firestorm. The Queen is \u2018shocked\u2019, it announced (without providing a source for the assertion), but what is she shocked by? Not, it turns out when you read on, her grandson\u2019s behaviour, but \u2018the publication of the pictures\u2019. Is Harry in trouble? A neat paragraph stated: \u2018Despite reports that he would be dragged up to Scotland to explain himself in person to both his grandmother and his father\u2026 royal sources said they were not aware of this.\u2019 So no, he\u2019s not in trouble. Has Harry let down the army? Alas, precious little support could be found for that argument either, though unnamed \u2018military sources\u2019 were quoted saying he \u2018could face a stern dressing-down\u2019. That\u2019s \u2018could\u2019, not \u2018will\u2019 or \u2018is likely to\u2019, and that\u2019s the best the Mail could do. So probably not. Has he jeopardised his own safety? The Mail had a go, speculating about where the prince\u2019s \u2018taxpayer-funded police protection officer\u2019 had worn his gun while in the pool with Harry, but there was no help from the head of the Met, Bernard Hogan-Howe, who just said it wasn\u2019t the officer\u2019s duty to regulate Harry\u2019s life. And infuriatingly for the Mail the prince isn\u2019t even grovelling, but is reported by unnamed friends to be \u2018fairly bullish\u2019 and \u2018not eating an awful lot of humble pie\u2019. So what is left, if the firestorm is just a balloon of hot air? In fact something big and solid is left: the Mail\u2019s fury that it has been told not to publish the pictures. That is the real message of those first five ranting, prurient pages. They are telling us that everybody else \u2013 all these sleazy websites and American newspapers \u2013 is allowed to publish them, but not us, not the British press. And it\u2019s not fair. Why, you might ask, does the Mail want to publish the pictures? Plainly it takes the view that the prince has done something wrong (or \u2018shocking\u2019, to use Amanda Platell\u2019s word), otherwise there can be no explanation for five whole pages of huffing and puffing. No one reading them could conclude otherwise than that the Mail firmly believes that princes should not drink and take their clothes off at parties in Las Vegas. So if the Mail disapproves, why does it want to show pictures of the activities it disapproves of? Why does it want to print pictures of the naked prince? What grounds does it offer to justify its demand?

A North Carolina dilemma.", "abstract": "North Carolina, along with the rest of the nation, faces a number of dilemmas regarding management of hazardous waste: 1. North Carolina businesses and industries generate a lot of hazardous waste, but the state lacks the capacity to manage it. For many, it has been acceptable to ship the waste to other states for treatment, storage, and disposal. Some of the receiving states have indicated that they are no longer willing to serve as the \"dumping ground\" for North Carolina. 2. North Carolina, along with the EPA, has identified a number of hazardous waste sites now listed on the NPL. However, the state was excluded from its regional agreement with Alabama, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee in January 1991, meaning that Superfund monies may be withdrawn and that cleanup won't be completed at these sites. 3. Every year the country produces at least 260 million tons of hazardous waste--more than one ton for every man, woman, and child. Those opposed to constructing hazardous waste treatment facilities charge that businesses and industries should reduce their hazardous waste to zero or near zero, and they charge that the state is not doing enough to encourage waste reduction. North Carolina's hazardous waste regulations already require programs to minimize the amounts of waste generated by industries, but for most industrial processes, it is impossible to reduce the generation of waste to zero. However, industries must continue to reduce their waste through source reduction and recycling. Hazardous waste and toxic materials do pose a risk to human health and the environment unless properly managed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0026887056", "pmid": "1630504", "issn": "00292559"}, "source": "North Carolina medical journal", "authors": [{"first_name": "T.

Identification shall occur as early as can reasonably be done and can be based on grades, observations, diagnostic and formative assessments, State assessments, and other factors, including reading on grade level, that impact student performance that teachers and administrators consider appropriate, without having to await the results of end-of-grade or end-of-course tests. No later than the end of the first quarter, or after a teacher has had up to nine weeks of instructional time with a student, a personal education plan for academic improvement with focused intervention and performance benchmarks shall be developed or updated for any student at risk of academic failure who is not performing at least at grade level, as identified by the State end-of-grade test and other factors noted above. Focused instructional supports and services, reading interventions, and accelerated activities should include evidence-based practices that meet the needs of students and may include coaching, mentoring, tutoring, summer school, Saturday school, and extended days. Local school administrative units shall provide these activities free of charge to students. Local school administrative units shall also provide transportation free of charge to all students for whom transportation is necessary for participation in these activities. Local school administrative units shall give notice of the personal education plan and a copy of the personal education plan to the student's parent or guardian. Parents should be included in the implementation and ongoing review of personal education plans. If a student's school report card provides all the information required in a personal education plan, then no further personal education plan is mandated for the student. Local school administrative units shall certify that they have complied with this section annually to the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education shall periodically review data on the progress of identified students and report to the Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee. No cause of action for monetary damages shall arise from the failure to provide or implement a personal education plan under this section. (b) Local boards of education shall adopt and implement plans for the creation of transition teams and transition plans for students at risk, as defined by the State Board of Education, to assist them in making a successful transition between the elementary school and middle school years and between the middle school and high school years.

The design of the parliament and democratic practice was informed by the capabilities offered by these new technologies and, consequently, it is of interest to explore the response of parliamentarians to this new setting.

A total of 387 patients were investigated; 220 (75%) were female and 214 (55%) of those were < 18 years of age. After a routine examination, intermittent photic, pattern, and television stimulation were performed in a standardized way. The patients were investigated with Super Mario World and a standard relatively nonprovocative TV program, both on a 50- and 100-Hz television. Regardless of the distance, Super Mario World proved to be more provocative than the standard program (Wilcoxon, p < 0.05). Eighty-five percent showed epileptiform discharges evoked by intermittent photic stimulation. Forty-five percent of patients were 50-Hz television sensitive and 26% were 100-Hz television sensitive. Pattern sensitivity was found in 28% of patients. The patients, referred because of a television, video- or computer-game seizure, were significantly more sensitive to pattern and to the 50-Hz television (chi square, p < 0.001). More patients are sensitive when playing Super Mario, compared with the standard program (Wilcoxon, p = 0.001) and more sensitive with playing versus viewing (p = 0.016). Of the patients who were referred because of seizures in front of the television, or evoked by a video- or computer game, 14% proved not to be photosensitive. Although no difference in age or use of medication was found, twice as many men were found in this nonphotosensitive group.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0032864981", "pmid": "10487177", "doi": "10.1111/j.1528-1157.1999.tb00910.x", "isbn": "0013-9580 (Print)\\r0013-9580", "issn": "0013-9580"}, "source": "Epilepsia", "authors": [{"first_name": "D G", "last_name": "Kasteleijn-Nolst Trenit\u00e9"}, {"first_name": "a M", "last_name": "da Silva"}, {"first_name": "S", "last_name": "Ricci"}, {"first_name": "C D", "last_name": "Binnie"}, {"first_name": "G", "last_name": "Rubboli"}, {"first_name": "C a", "last_name": "Tassinari"}, {"first_name": "J P", "last_name": "Segers"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/videogame-epilepsy-european-study", "year": 1999, "keywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Distribution", "Electroencephalography", "Electroencephalography: statistics & numerical dat", "Epilepsy", "Epilepsy: diagnosis", "Epilepsy: epidemiology", "Epilepsy: etiology", "Europe", "Europe: epidemiology", "Female", "Humans", "Light", "Light: adverse effects", "Male", "Patient Education as Topic", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Pattern Recognition, Visual: physiology", "Photic Stimulation", "Photic Stimulation: adverse effects", "Sex Distribution", "Sunlight", "Sunlight: adverse effects", "Television", "Video Games", "Video Games: adverse effects"], "type": "journal", "id": "d63062cb-dc5b-35a1-a09c-dde067206d2c"}, {"title": "The Medium of the Video Game", "abstract": "\"This book offers a historical, formal analysis of video games that no other book to date has provided in such detail. . . .

In the past, gaming was the domain of young males, and game studios devoted considerable resources to titles that appealed almost exclusively to this demographic. Today, as development costs skyrocket and video game companies compete for the same customers, more studios are finding success in markets that traditionally have not been well served by the video game industry. Today\u2019s gamers include women, parents, and even senior citizens who enjoy playing puzzle games, arcade games, and sports games. Among 25\u2013 34 year olds, women gamers now outnumber men by a considerable margin. Casual gaming comes in different forms. Some companies are reviving classic arcade games from the 1970s and 1980s that have nostalgic appeal for audiences that grew up during the era of Atari and the NES. Other companies specialize in puzzle games like Tetris and Bejeweled that are distributed on handheld devices, on Internet websites, or on low-cost CD-ROM packages. And as we saw in an earlier chapter, Nintendo created a new genre of fitness titles by combining simple sports games with its Wiimote controller. In this chapter we will look at how game development has changed and why the traditional approach to video game marketing is no longer working. Under the new paradigm, large game companies have had to rethink the way they do business. The most successful ones are partnering with small innovative studios, creating tools that help facilitate community-based development, and focusing big-budget resources on their most successful franchises.

Should a game be serious in order to stimulate cognitive aptitudes?", "abstract": "The vogue of massive commercialization of video games has prompted the development of methods for brain training on game consoles. Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training??? even benefited from an intense media campaign with celebrities. However, a previous study (Lorant-Royer et al., 2008) proves that, in six tests (school-related or inspired by the WISC-IV), the effect of training from the Kawashima program or recreational brain training (Brain Academy), is lacking or weak (+20%) and does not exceed paper-pencil games (Mickey games) or control group (without training). However, other studies show a cognitive effect particularly on attention, suggesting that the practice of video games could improve specific cognitive capacities used in video games such as attention, manual dexterity, visual and spatial memory, etc. In this sense, any recreational game could have the same effects as the so-called Brain Training program. This study adopts the general methodology of Lorant-Royer et al., comparing this time Dr Kawashima's Brain Training ??? to a recreational game (New Super Mario Bros???), paper-pencil games (Mickey games) as \"placebo\" and a control group (without training) in 10 tests focused on visual attention, manual dexterity and visuospatial memory. Eighty-eight pupils aged 10 years and 2 months on average were divided into four groups and were evaluated twice (pretests and post-tests) before and after 11 training sessions in the games. The results were very disappointing. Of the 10 tests, only the \"brain training\" had a weak positive effect (+18.15%) in the right hand dexterity test. Conversely, the group playing the \"Super Mario\" game registered a positive effect (+23.91%) on the visual span test. In conclusion, recreational training will neither be sufficiently specific nor sufficiently long (in terms of training years) in order to obviously develop cognitive abilities. ?? 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Aimed mainly at undergraduate and early graduate students of mathematics and computer science. It is written with the goal of stimulating interest in mathematics and an active, problem-solving approach to the presented material. The reader is led to an understanding of the basic principles and methods of actually doing mathematics (and having fun at that). Being more narrowly focused than many discrete mathematics textbooks and treating selected topics in an unusual depth and from several points of view, the book reflects the conviction of the authors, active and internationally renowned mathematicians, that the most important gain from studying mathematics is the cultivation of clear and logical thinking and habits useful for attacking new problems. More than 400 enclosed exercises with a wide range of difficulty, many of them accompanied by hints for solution, support this approach to teaching. The readers will appreciate the lively and informal style of the text accompanied by more than 200 drawings and diagrams. Specialists in various parts of science with a basic mathematical education wishing to apply discrete mathematics in their field can use the book as a useful source, and even experts in combinatorics may occasionally learn from pointers to research literature or from presentations of recent results. Invitation to Discrete Mathematics should make a delightful reading both for beginners and for mathematical professionals. The main topics include: elementary counting problems, asymptotic estimates, partially ordered sets, basic graph theory and graph algorithms, finite projective planes, elementary probability and the probabilistic method, generating functions, Ramsey's theorem, and combinatorial applications of linear algebra. General mathematical notions going beyond the high-school level are thoroughly explained in the introductory chapter. An appendix summarizes the undergraduate algebra needed in some of the more advanced sections of the book.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-57849105514", "issn": "08981221", "isbn": "9780198502074", "doi": "10.1016/S0898-1221(99)90355-3"}, "source": "Computers & Mathematics with Applications", "authors": [{"first_name": "Discrete", "last_name": "Mathematics"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/invitation-discrete-mathematics", "year": 1999, "type": "journal", "id": "2c12470c-0d82-3c3e-b038-19ed310d1d24"}, {"title": "Mathematics", "abstract": "Now in its eighth edition, Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook offers unrivaled, up-to-date coverage of all aspects of chemical engineering.

Comparing a control with a video gaming training group that was trained for 2 months for at least 30 min per day with a platformer game, we found significant gray matter (GM) increase in right hippocampal formation (HC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral cerebellum in the training group.

GM increases in HC and DLPFC correlated with participants' desire for video gaming, evidence suggesting a predictive role of desire in volume change. Video game training augments GM in brain areas crucial for spatial navigation, strategic planning, working memory and motor performance going along with evidence for behavioral changes of navigation strategy.

Nonadaptationist versions contend that the mental architecture of the brain is wired for religious thinking but that religious concepts have piggybacked on other cognitive adaptations, especially those for agency detection. Religious concepts are not evolved biological adaptations but rather by-products of more general cognitive structures that are adaptations. Adaptationist versions concentrate on the benefits provided by religion, such as increased social cohesion and the individual benefits that stem from it, such as better physical and mental health and greater longevity. After clarifying the meaning of the terms \"adaptation\" and \"adaptationism,\" this article presents four lines of evidence in favor of the adaptationist position: (1) in the ancestral environment the role of the shaman was nearly universal and was primarily devoted to the crucial human goals of curing illness and protecting and finding vital resources; (2) religion generally has positive effects on both physical and mental health; (3) religions tend to be pro-natalist and more religious people tend to leave more offspring than less religious or nonreligious people; (4) the major world religions that evolved in the first millennium BCE during a period of major social chaos and disruption emphasized an omnipotent, transcendent God of love and mercy who offered salvation in a heavenly afterlife and released individuals from earthly suffering. None of these facts demonstrate conclusively that cognitive modules specifically oriented to supernatural agents evolved by natural selection, but they are highly suggestive and make a good inferential case. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Religion is rather a life practice than a worldview. This thesis is developed in both conversation and dispute with philosophical and anthropological approaches to religion. On the one hand, an understanding of religion as practice cop- ing with contingency is dealt with. On the other hand, some insights of ritual studies regarding religion as genuine ritual practice are addressed. Both positions have sig- nifi cant shortcomings; the fi rst strictly separates religious practice from other forms of action; the second rightly underlines the aspects of liminality and communitas but neglects the ambiguity of rituals which can not only establish true community but can become compulsive as well. Therefore, the theory of communicative action, introduced by J\u00fcrgen Habermas is taken into account. The paper sketches how Habermas in his earlier writings con- sidered religion as having become obsolete in modernity and thus replaced by com- municative action. However, his views of religion have considerably changed in the last decade. In the meanwhile, he insists that religion contains a communicative poten- tial and that religious communities must not be marginalized or excommunicated by secular thinking. On the contrary, they belong to the public sphere where they play an inspiring and remembering role. Taking up central insights from Habermas\u2019 philosophical theory of communica- tive action and integrating them into fundamental theology, I claim that religion itself is a constitutive communicative practice. Following Helmut Peukert and others I try to make clear, that communicative religious speech and action has a creative, an innova- tive and an anamnestic potential. Religion takes place within religious communities and traditions, and it is done in communicative faith practice. It is performed in different forms of communicative-religious action. The paper underlines that witnessing and confessing are two elementary acts of monotheistic religions. It then turns to fur- ther forms of communicative-religious practice and addresses narrating, celebrating, proclaiming and sharing. Finally, some guidelines for a communicative theology are pointed out, encom- passing its academic, ecclesial, communicative and critical dimensions, related to religion(s) and both directed to and aiming at the creative, innovative and rescuing reality of God.", "authors": [{"first_name": "Edmund", "last_name": "Arens"}], "source": "Religion", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/religion-religion-2", "year": 2007, "keywords": ["J.

Throughout human history, people have killed in the name of their gods. Emile Durkheim rightly stressed that religion serves to strengthen the bonds of solidarity among those who worship the same god, in the same way. But the flip side of this solidarity is enmity towards those who worship other gods or worship the same god differently. Religious boundaries separate the pure and virtuous \u2018us\u2019 from the impure and evil \u2018them\u2019. We who worship our god our way are truly human. The Other, who worships other gods, or the same god differently, is less than human and thus killable. Yet while the hostility towards the Other found in most sacred scriptures has often had lethal consequences, one cannot assume that these texts dic- tate the actual behaviour of believers for all time. Scriptures are constantly being reinterpreted as historical circumstances change. And some conflicts in which sacred texts get invoked may infact have secular causes. \ue021 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Even a decade earlier, when Edwin Arnold was conceiving and writing The Light of Asia, there was already a large and growing number of books in English about Buddhism and translations of Buddhist texts, although the subject was not nearly so popular as Arnold's bestselling poem would soon make it. It is a misconception that the Europeans of a century ago had no accurate knowledge of, and little interest in, the cultures and religions of Asia . While the interest had been growing for over a hundred years, however, the knowledge was mostly of recent origin and dated from the discovery by European scholars, in roughly the second quarter of the nineteenth century, of voluminous Buddhist religious texts in Nepal, Tibet, Mongolia and Ceylon. Within a remarkably short time enough of this material had been translated or made the basis of books about Buddhism to create, if not satisfy, an interest which soon spread beyond the circle of professional philologists and Orientalists. In the late eighteenth century Sir William Jones, a leading Sanskrit scholar, had expressed the opinion that Buddha was simply an Oriental corruption of the name of the god Odin. Seventy- five years later his successors were searching learnedly through a mass of literature in five or six languages for the historical Buddha, and their researches were having not merely scholarly but philosophical and religious impact on English and European society.

A flat plate bilge keel and one more complex shaped bilge keel were studied to investigate the geometry effect. The draft of the cylinder was varied to study the effect of the vicinity of the free surface on the bilge keel loads and hull pressures. The rotation axis of the cylinder was fixed to define a pure roll experiment (one degree of freedom).The cylinder was subject to forced oscillations of varying amplitude leading to a KC range of 0.3-16. Using Fourier analysis the first three harmonic coefficients representing the normal bilge keel load were derived. The first harmonic drag and inertia coefficients are in good agreement to existing experimental data obtained for wall bounded flat plates fitted in a U-shaped water tunnel as reported by Sarpkaya and O'Keefe (1996). New insight is gained by the fact that the addition of higher harmonic contributions is essential to capture the time varying bilge keel normal force. The pressure measurements next to the bilge keel are compared to measurements reported by Ikeda et al. (1979). Similar findings are obtained, showing that the pressure on the hull in front of the moving bilge keel is KC independent while the vortex system in the wake of the bilge keel leads to KC dependent hull pressure distributions. The hull pressure jump over the bilge keel correlates well to the force coefficient on the bilge keel. The complex nature of the vortex induced hull pressures is manifested. The empirically derived hull pressure distribution by Ikeda et al. (1979) for the time instant of maximum velocity is shown to correlate reasonably well to the measured data with some conservatism in the absolute value. Although a cylinder is very different from a ship-shaped section, the experiments provide essential insight into the physics associated with roll damping and into the factors that should be included in a roll damping prediction method.", "identifiers": {"doi": "10.1016/j.apor.2015.07.001", "issn": "01411187"}, "source": "Applied Ocean Research", "authors": [{"first_name": "R. van\u2019t", "last_name": "Veer"}, {"first_name": "X.B.", "last_name": "Schut"}, {"first_name": "R.H.M.", "last_name": "Huijsmans"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/bilge-keel-loads-hull-pressures-created-bilge-keels-fitted-rotating-cylinder", "year": 2015, "keywords": ["bilge keels normal force"], "type": "journal", "id": "659b6067-23db-3f4a-9662-b3e2943f30f2"}, {"title": "COMMISSIONING AND ROUTINE TESTING OF FULL FIELD DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY SYSTEMS NHSBSP Equipment Report 0604 September 2006", "abstract": "The original version of this report, dated June 2006, was prepared by the Digital Working Party of the NHSBSP QA Coordinating Group for Physics.

We define a ??-Steiner hull ??-SH(Z) of Z as a set obtained by a maximal sequence of removals of certain open wedge-shaped regions from an initial hull followed by a simplification of its boundary. A perhaps surprising result is presented, namely that a Euclidean MST for Z can be used to decompose the problem of finding ??-SH(Z) into subproblems. Each of these can then be solved recursively using linear searches combined with a sweep line approach. Using this result, we present an algorithm computing ??-SH(Z). This algorithm has O(??nlogn) running time and O(??n) space requirement which is optimal for constant ??.

Its primary concern is the uneven distribution of access to the technologies and the information skills required to participate in electronic communication, which is likely to have profound implications for economic, cultural and social development in all societies around the world. This topic formed the basis for a seminar organised by the Community Informatics Research and Applications Unit (CIRA) based at the University of Teesside, from which the majority of the chapters in this volume originate. Perhaps it is unsurprising that the issue of exclusion from the information age should find a particular resonance in an area steeped in the traditions and culture of the industrial society and increasingly subject to the process of deindustrialisation. All the papers have been fully revised as a result of the lively and productive debate during the conference and the reflection that has followed thereafter. Indeed, the issue of disparity between the information-advantaged and those who may be excluded from the benefits of the information technology revolution has continued to rise up the agenda of politicians around the globe. To date, however, discussion has been somewhat dominated by the over-optimistic and prescriptive pronouncements of some policy makers and practitioners through their proclamations of the arrival of the information society. The contributors to this volume, whilst recognising the potential of ICTs to foster significant social and economic change, have attempted to counter these Utopian and frequently deterministic accounts by including considerations of T power, economic advantage, human agency, social struggle and resistance as significant factors affecting the social and economic shaping of technology and its impact upon social structure. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the participants of the original conference for their stimulating contributions, enthusiastic desire to engage in a multidisciplinary exercise, and their good company. The task of editing a collection is always made more enjoyable by the good quality of the material and reliability of the authors, for which again I would like to make known my appreciation. I am also grateful to Heather Gibson for her support and encouragement as Routledges editor, as well as for the capable assistance of her colleague Fiona Bailey. The project itself could not of course have materialised without the organisational competence and skills of the CIRA team and so I am indebted to Jo Brudenell, for running the conference with her usual flair; to June Ions, for her help in compilation and word processing; and especially to Dave Eagle for all his advice, support and time which is always so generously given and which makes him such a good colleague to have the privilege to work with.

Does there exist an analogue of this result in contact geometry? Our main finding is that the answer depends on the sizes of the domains in question: We establish contact non-squeezing on large scales, and show that it disappears on small scales. The algebraic counterpart of the (non)-squeezing problem for contact domains is the question of existence of a natural partial order on the universal cover of the contactomorphisms group of a contact manifold. In contrast to our earlier beliefs, we show that the answer to this question is very sensitive to the topology of the manifold. For instance, we prove that the standard contact sphere is non-orderable while the real projective space is known to be orderable. Our methods include a new embedding technique in contact geometry as well as a generalized Floer homology theory which contains both cylindrical contact homology and Hamiltonian Floer homology. We discuss links to a number of miscellaneous topics such as topology of free loops spaces, quantum mechanics and semigroups.

In addition to the usual considerations of membrane science and technology, and of membrane materials or membrane cells per se, another item of interest lies in establishing the derivations and process-type calculations involved in predicting the degree of membrane separation that can be attained. It is a matter more complicated than ordinarily thought or expected, and is allied with the unit operations concept as embodied in chemical and process engineering. Some recent developments in membrane processes for the separation of organic liquids have been previously noted, as has the use of hyperfiltration as applied in ethanol recovery. Filtration per se is of relevance in the processing of nonpasteurized beers, for example in the separation of spent yeasts after fermentation. The more modern embodiment for the membrane separation notably of gases is the diffusion-type mechanism, whereby the gases actually dissolve in the material and pass through by molecular diffusion. Another embodiment is the facilitated transport membrane, which acts as an absorber on the high-pressure side and as an absorbent regenerator on the low-pressure side. Investigations have also been made concerning liquid membranes. Metal or metallic membranes are also under study, as are ceramics, whereas the usual materials are polymeric in nature.

In particular, we study the following problem: given a set L of n lines in the plane, we wish to preprocess L such that later, upon receiving a set P of n points, each of which lies on a distinct line of L, we can construct the convex hull of P efficiently. We show that in quadratic time and space it is possible to construct a data structure on L that enables us to compute the convex hull of any such point set P in O (n \u03b1 (n) log \n                        * n) expected time. If we further assume that the points are \"oblivious\" with respect to the data structure, the running time improves to O (n \u03b1 (n)). The same result holds when L is a set of line segments (in general position). We present several extensions, including a trade-off between space and query time and an output-sensitive algorithm. We also study the \"dual problem\" where we show how to efficiently compute the (\u2264 k)-level of n lines in the plane, each of which is incident to a distinct point (given in advance). We complement our results by \u03a9 (n log n) lower bounds under the algebraic computation tree model for several related problems, including sorting a set of points (according to, say, their x-order), each of which lies on a given line known in advance. Therefore, the convex hull problem under our setting is easier than sorting, contrary to the \"standard\" convex hull and sorting problems, in which the two problems require \u0398 (n log n) steps in the worst case (under the algebraic computation tree model). \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The method is both powerful (it contains many other term structure models as special cases) and easy to understand. It exactly fits the initial term structure of interest rates, it permits as complex a volatility structure as desired, and it can readily be extended to as many sources of risk as desired. More recently the HJM model has been modified by Brace, Gatarek and Musiella (1997), Jamshidian (1997), and Miltersen, Sandmann, and Sondermann (1997) to apply to noninstantaneous forward rates. This modification has come to be known as the Libor Market Model (LMM). In one version, 3-month forward rates are modeled. This allows the model to exactly replicate observed cap prices that depend on 3-month forward rates. In another version forward swap rates are modeled. This allows the model to exactly replicate observed European swap option prices. The main difficulty with the HJM - LMM models is that they are difficult to implement by any means other then Monte Carlo simulation. As a result they are computationally slow and difficult to use for American or Bermudan style options. The other major approach to modeling the term structure is to describe the evolution of the instantaneous rate of interest, the rate that applies over the next short interval of time. Short rate models are often more difficult to understand than models of the forward rate. However, they are implemented in the form of a recombining tree similar to the stock price tree first developed by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979).

If open- hole data are not available, in many instances a cased hole sonic log can be recorded for this purpose. These synthetics are extremely valuable in verifying reflection events in a seis- mic section and relating seismic features to geological struc- tures.

We find the specific angular momentum j of prestellar cloud cores in our models to be on average comparable to the observed values. A fraction of prestellar cores is gravitationally unstable and goes into collapse to build up protostars and protostellar systems. Their specific angular momentum is one order of magnitude lower than their parental cores and in agreement with observations of main-sequence binaries. The ratio of rotational to gravitational energy of protostellar cores in the model turns out to be very similar to the observed values. We find, that it is roughly conserved during the main collapse phase. This leads to j proportional to M 2/3, where j is specific angular momentum and M core mass. Although the temporal evolution of the angular momentum of individual protostars or protostellar systems is complex and highly time variable, this correlation holds well in a statistical sense for a wide range of turbulent environmental parameters. In addition, high turbulent Mach numbers result in the formation of more numerous protostellar cores with, on average, lower mass. Therefore, models with larger Mach numbers result in cores with lower specific angular momentum. We find, however, no dependence on the spatial scale of the turbulence. Our models predict a close correlation between the angular momentum vectors of neighboring protostars during their main accretion phase. Possible observational signatures are aligned disks and parallel outflows. The latter are indeed observed in some low-mass isolated Bok globules.", "authors": [{"first_name": "A K", "last_name": "Jappsen"}, {"first_name": "R S", "last_name": "Klessen"}], "source": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/protostellar-angular-momentum-evolution-during-gravoturbulent-fragmentation", "year": 2004, "type": "journal", "id": "5145f7e7-f816-3d93-a9a1-28bd05f5b99c"}, {"title": "Improved angular momentum evolution model for solar-like stars", "abstract": "Context. Understanding the origin and evolution of stellar angular momentum is one of the major challenges of stellar physics. Aims: We present new models for the rotational evolution of solar-like stars between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with the aim of reproducing the distributions of rotational periods observed for star forming regions and young open clusters within this age range. Methods: The models include a new wind braking law based on recent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo and mass-loss prescriptions are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular velocity. The models additionally assume constant angular velocity during the disk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative core and the convective envelope as soon as the former develops. Results: We have developed rotational evolution models for slow, median, and fast rotators with initial periods of 10, 7, and 1.4 d, respectively. The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behavior of solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 4.5 Gyr, including pre-main sequence (PMS) to zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) spin up, prompt ZAMS spin down, and the early-main sequence (MS) convergence of surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting for the slow and median rotators are very similar to each other, with a disk lifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale of 28-30 Myr. In contrast, fast rotators have both shorter disk lifetimes (2.5 Myr) and core-envelope coupling timescales (12 Myr). We show that a large amount of angular momentum is hidden in the radiative core for as long as 1 Gyr in these models and we discuss the implications for internal differential rotation and lithium depletion. We emphasize that these results are highly dependent on the adopted braking law. We also report a tentative correlation between the initial rotational period and disk lifetime, which suggests that protostellar spin down by massive disks in the embedded phase is at the origin of the initial dispersion of rotation rates in young stars. Conclusions: We conclude that this class of semi-empirical models successfully grasp the main trends of the rotational behavior of solar-type stars as they evolve and make specific predictions that may serve as a guide for further development.

Methods: By minimizing the total mechanical energy of a given system under the constraint of stellar angular momentum loss, we rigorously find the conditions for the existence of dynamical equilibrium states. We estimate their duration, in particular when the wind torque spinning down the star is almost compensated for by the tidal torque spinning it up. We introduce dimensionless variables to characterize the tidal evolution of observed hot Jupiter systems and discuss their spin and orbital states using generalized Darwin diagrams based on our new approach.  Results: We show that their orbital properties are related to the effective temperature of their host stars. The long-term evolution of planets orbiting F- and G-type stars is significantly different owing to the combined effect of magnetic braking and tidal dissipation. The existence of a quasi-stationary state, in the case of short-period planets, can significantly delay their tidal evolution that would otherwise bring the planet to fall into its host star. Most of the planets known to orbit F-type stars are presently found to be near this stationary state, probably in a configuration not too far from what they had when their host star settled on the zero-age main sequence. Considering the importance of angular momentum loss in the early stages of stellar evolution, our results indicate that it has to be considered to properly test the migration scenarios of planetary system formation.

Stark (250) first evaluates the likelihood that there was a Postclassic Aztec Empire.  She argues that in contrast to Teotihuacan, the Aztec Triple Alliance need to rely on indirect form of control due to the fragmentary nature of the core of the empire and the limits of transportation.  More control and economic reorganization is present in near provinces such as Morelos than in those distant on the GUf Coast.  Because of transport costs, the focus of Aztec tribute demands along the Gulf Coast consisted of feathers, cotton, cacao, and textiles. There are abundant foriegn commodities and materials found in the Aztec capitals, indicating conquest and subsequent tribute extraction of foriegn provinces.  Contrasting this pattern, Teotihuacan had foriegn materials but very little indicated commodities were imported from conquered regions.  For this reason, Stark finds Teotihuacan less oriented toward militiary conquest and less likely to have been an empire.  The control over trade networks evident with Teotihuacan more likely involved small amounts of prestige goods rather than large scale interaction evident in classic world system theory (Wallerstein 1976).    Stark next evaluates several models of interregional interaction.  First, imperial incorporation comes in the form of direct or indirect administration.  Direct administration involves tribute flow into the capital but some counterflow in the form of prestige gifts.  Indirect administration also involves tribute but less imperial penetration into the province.  The empire would have no state storage facilities of military garrisons in the province.  In both of these forms, provincial production may become reoriented around tribute production.  In the direct administered  form, provincial hierarchies go through considerable restructuring.  The settlement patterns may even be reorganized around imperial economic demands.  The indirect forms see only the top administrative personel replaced, if anyone.    Assymetrical alliances involve few tribute relations but prestige gifts are given to make alliances.  Local production will remain unaltered but local status symbols may change.  Finally there is no reorganization of the social or settlement hierarchy.  Elite relations is much the same, but should be seen as only elite interaction with even less economic interpenetration that with assymetrical alliances.  The production systems, social and settlement hierarchies wil look the same as with assymetrical alliances above.    Nonrelations can still exist and foriegn material may be present but they arrived through stylistic emulation or through a third party.    Stark summarizes the Aztec relations with La Mixtequilla as involving \"minimal administrative investment in selected communities, periodic attacks, and tribute collection over some 65 years (264)\".  She procedes that there are material indicators including stylistically emulated ceramics and green obsidian that point toward interaction with the Basin of Mexico.  She suggests that the evidence points to indirect administration.  There was also one possible garrison located just outside La Mixtequilla.  IN contrast, Middle Classic relations she characterizes as assymetrical alliances or elite relations.  There was no reorganization of social structure or settlement.  However, material indicators suggest interaction that makes her not want to rule out indirect administration (274).", "identifiers": {"isbn": "0190-1281"}, "source": "Research in Economic Anthropology", "authors": [{"first_name": "Barbara L", "last_name": "Stark"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/gulf-coast-central-highlands-mexico-alternative-models-interaction", "year": 1990, "keywords": ["Archaeology--Mexico", "Commerce, Prehistoric--Mexico", "Indians of Mexico--Veracruz (State)--Antiquities", "Mexico--Antiquities"], "type": "book_section", "id": "829587ea-e76c-3069-8b94-da2e2bfa03b7"}, {"title": "The health effects of peacekeeping (Bosnia, 1992-1996): a cross-sectional study--comparison with nondeployed military personnel.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to test the hypothesis that United Kingdom soldiers who were deployed to Bosnia had worse health than a nondeployed control group. METHODS: We used data from a cross-sectional study designed to examine the health effects of service in the Persian Gulf War, which collected data in 1997 to 1998. We compared the two control groups--(personnel who were deployed to Bosnia and a nondeployed control group of military personnel (Era))--on a number of health-related outcomes, including physical functioning, symptoms and ailments, psychological health, fatigue, and post-traumatic stress reactions. RESULTS: The response rate for the Bosnia cohort was 62.9% and for the Era group 61.9%. A proportion of the Bosnia group had served in the Persian Gulf War and was found to have considerably worse health outcomes than the remaining Bosnia group or the Era group. The Bosnia group who had not served in the Persian Gulf War had broadly similar health outcomes to the Era group. The main differences were that the Bosnia-only group consumed more alcohol and reported more fatigue, hay fever, weight gain, irritability, avoidance, and night sweats. Apart from heavy alcohol consumption, the magnitude of these differences was small. The Bosnia-only group had slightly better physical functioning than the Era group, and there were two other symptoms and one ailment which were less common in the Bosnia-only group than in the Era group. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the health of United Kingdom military personnel who served in Bosnia from 1992 to 1996 was generally good in 1997 to 1998. However, further surveillance of veterans of the Balkan's War is required in the light of recent concerns.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "12775179", "issn": "0026-4075 (Print) 0026-4075", "isbn": "0026-4075"}, "source": "Military medicine", "authors": [{"first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Hotopf"}, {"first_name": "Anthony", "last_name": "David"}, {"first_name": "Lisa", "last_name": "Hull"}, {"first_name": "Khalida", "last_name": "Ismail"}, {"first_name": "Catherine", "last_name": "Unwin"}, {"first_name": "Simon", "last_name": "Wessely"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/health-effects-peacekeeping-bosnia-19921996-crosssectional-studycomparison-nondeployed-military-pers", "year": 2003, "type": "journal", "id": "1b086ea3-6e1e-3b94-af3a-5617a61e1500"}, {"title": "Mesohaline Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Survey Along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Coast, 2001 and 2002: A Salinity Gradient Approach", "abstract": "Distribution of marine submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV; i.e., seagrass) in the northern Gulf of Mexico coast has been documented, but there are nonmarine submersed or SAV species occurring in estuarine salinities that have not been extensively reported.

A total of 20 SAV and algal species was identified and habitat characteristics such as salinity, water depth, pH, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and sediment composition were collected. Fourteen SAV species occurred two or more times in our samples. The most frequently occurring species was Ruppia maritima L. (n = 148), occurring in over half of SAV beds sampled. Eleocharis sp.

The failure to understand the form, function, and logic of clandestine cellular networks has led to the incorrect application of counternetwork theories. Counternetwork operations specifically targeting key leaders, facilitators, individuals with special skills, or highly connected individuals, intuitively seem to be the correct targets for disconnecting clandestine cellular networks. However, there has been little comparative analysis done to verify if these operations are in fact having the overall effect required to disrupt, neutralize, defeat, or ultimately destroy these networks. Understanding the form, function, and logic of clandestine cellular networks reveals that the removal of single individuals, regardless of function, is well within the tolerance of this type of organizational structure and thus has little long-term effect. At the same time, highly connected nodes violate the principles of clandestine operations since they are obviously highly visible when compared to a competent clandestine practitioner that does not want a discernable signature in order to remain hidden from the counterinsurgent. Thus, by focusing on the highly connected individuals as high priority targets, US efforts have effectively \u201cculled the herd\u201d of poor clandestine practitioners. These two examples provide the two most common errors in the current counternetwork theories and operations, and the errors are all due to a lack of a systemic understanding of clandestine cellular networks. This monograph uses a modified process-trace methodology to analyze the form, function, and logic of clandestine cellular networks in order to dispel the myths associated with current network and counternetwork theories, and challenge the contemporary thoughts on counternetwork operations. This work concludes with the development of six principles of clandestine cellular networks, along with a myriad of conclusion based on the analysis of the form, function, and logic of these networks, to provide a deeper understanding of clandestine cellular networks.

The situation of intense bilingualism that has been present for years between these languages has influenced changes in Spanish that have consolidated into a stable norm in these regions. Through an analysis of the use of the atonic pronouns in the third person, we will show that the influence that Tzutujil exerts on Spanish shows itself in the simplification of the pronominal system of the direct object in Spanish. Spoken Spanish in these areas shows a tendency to use one invariable pronominal form without distinguishing between gender & number which in this case is lo (\"Y si la senorita al dia siguiente, digamos hoy en la tarde dejaron esa moneda en su guipil, y si lo regresan ahorita mismo piensan 'ah, no, eso no nos gusta, a nosotros no' ...\").

These team members are often well trained to perform their own part of the teamwork. However, for optimal performance they should also act as a team. The question is how optimal team performance can be realized swiftly. In this study we investigated the effect of a brief team strategy discussion. We hypothesized that a brief team strategy discussion in an ad hoc team at the start of a mission has a significant positive effect on the development of a shared mental model, on team processes, and with that on team performance. In an experimental setting, 46 four-person military ad hoc teams were presented with the distributed dynamic decision-making task. We gave half of the teams an instruction to develop a team strategy in 10 minutes, whereas the other half received no such instruction. Teams were randomly assigned to the two conditions. The results supported our hypotheses. A further exploration of the data showed that the teams in the team strategy condition showed more initiative and leadership. Finally, we concluded that accuracy gained more from the team strategy discussion than speed of operations. The results have important implications for military training and practice. \u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-70449447708", "issn": "0899-5605", "isbn": "0899-5605", "doi": "10.1080/08995600903249107"}, "source": "Military Psychology", "authors": [{"first_name": "Sander", "last_name": "Dalenberg"}, {"first_name": "Ad L.

Since texts can, obviously, carry narratives, assuming film also to be such an entity would provide a ready explanation of how they too can function as a narratival medium.\" (1) \"The notion of 'text' is a powerful one and, given the highly structured and conventionalised nature of filmic expression, the idea of 'film-as-text' has proven difficult to resist. In many current introductions to film studies, therefore, it is commonly taken for granted that film is, in some sense, a text. But the connection to linguistic views of text has largely been broken. Film is taken as a text only in some analogical fashion that no longer encourages an exchange of results between filmic text and the verbal.\" (2) - notions of 'semiotic codes', 'inference', 'discourse' and 'syntax' \"And for this, a clear understanding of the relations between semiotic codes, inference, discourse and syntax is of considerable importance. We will suggest that the connections usually drawn in fact distort 'textuality' to the point where it cannot apply to film - thereby validating the criticisms that have been brought against semiotic and linguistic approaches. However, these distortiongs also render the weakened notion of textuality that results equally inapplicable to verbal discourse. A general overhaul of the conceptual area is therefore long overdue.\" (2) Film is, indeed, nothing like a semiotic code modelled on the static view appropriate for linguistic syntax; but, as we shall see, neither is language.\" (3) - Relevance Theory: \"In this account, semantic representations are derived largely automatically following a semiotic code, but only in order to serve as a starting point for the real process of inferential interpretation (Sperber and Wilson 1995: 175-176). This again draws the distinction between coded, non-inferential mechanisms, and a further process of inferential interpretation.\" (3) \"The principal work of interpretation, for both film and text, is in the performance of inference.\" (3) \"Strongly pragmatic or contextual approaches to language and avowedly non-codal approaches to film then share a position in which: (a) inference takes over the 'significant' work and (b) that inference is not influenced by the specificity of the semiotic code involved. Only then does it become possible to position oneself explicitly towards a pragmatic orientation instead of, or in opposition to, notions of semantics and semiotic codes. We shall argue that in fact we need both: semiotic codes and inference belong together. The question is precisely which kinds of inference belong where.\" (3f.) \"In particular, we realign semiotic code with discourse and dynamism rather than with the inherently contradictory pairing of discourse and staticity. To do this, we build directly on more recent views of discourse organisation and interpretation developed in both formal and functional linguistic work on discourse representation and discourse semantics. The essential idea, adopted from Asher and Lascarides (2003), is that it is benefitial for accounts of discourse to distinguish different layers of discourse interpretation intervening between sentence semantics and fully contextualised interpretation. Each layer is then made only as 'poweful' as necessary to get its immediate job done.\" (4) \"This is the level of discourse semantics, a resource that, on the one hand, allows particular meanings to be imposed on an unfolding discourse and, on the other, directly controls when and how appeal is to be made to world knowledge and context.\" (4) \"Our proposals for film illustrated below build on both of these foundations. Our argument will be that for film, just as for language, a level of constraining discourse semantics is appropriate and necessary for mediating between the details of a film-as-seen and the range of interpretations that may sensibly be built for that film ....\" (4) \"Explicit accounts of discourse semantics, on the other hand, allow us to characterise which aspects are to be attended to for the purpose of building discourse interpretations and which can be ignored. The analytical tools that we introduce therefore perform precisely this role of pre-structuring our access to filmic material so as to focus on the cues being mobilised for filmic discourse construction. It is in this sense that we see these tools as a bridge between filmic material and contextualised narrative interpretation.\" (5) \"We will show that well developed linguistic views of discourse can now provide a finely differentiating analytic framework for film also - as long as those views are extended appropriately for the specificities of the filmic semiotic mode(s).\" (5) \"We will argue in our analysis that, despite the film's apparent complexity, the viewer is nevertheless guided by the discourse semantics so as to construct a narrative unfolding that avoids and restricts disorientation, while simultaneously opening up a relatively precise range of preferred interpretations.\" (6) - socio-functional semiotics: \"Within this view formal units of film analysis, such as the 'shot', are seen as realising narrative but are not narrative units themselves. 'Realisation' is the semiotic relationship that holds between strata, which is often characterised as a relationship of co-patterning - that is, patterns at a more abstract level of description (higher stratum, such as discourse) regularly occur together with patterns at less abstract levels of description (lower strata, such as filmic devices and structural sequences). ... precisely the kind of flexibility that is required for film. It is this provision of several distinct strata related formally by realisation that allows us to start bridging the gap between the formal devices employed in a film and their (6) \"We have suggested here that the cues provided by cohesive chains actually go further, leading the viewer quite directly to particular connections and interpretations. We have also set out how cues based on the filmic material can be abstracted to provide information more directly relevant for narrative construction. This is the central role of discourse semantics: it is then not the cues directly that guide hypothesis generation and testing but their participation, in cohesive chains that, in turn, give rise to possible interpretations.\" (23)", "identifiers": {"isbn": "0922842X"}, "source": "Film", "authors": [{"first_name": "Chiaoi", "last_name": "Tseng"}, {"first_name": "John A", "last_name": "Bateman"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/chain-choice-filmic-narrative-analysis-multimodal-narrative-construction-fountain-1", "year": 2010, "type": "journal", "id": "925f396f-b3f4-39a3-a25b-49888d7fa9c3"}, {"title": "Film Marketing", "abstract": "Film Marketing is the first book to consolidate existing literature into a well informed and academically sound textbook.

A Case Study in Medieval Language Contact", "abstract": "This paper evaluates proposals for Latin influence on a number of developments in medieval Irish against recent theories of contact-induced change as presented by Thomason and Kaufman (1988) and Thomason (2001). Given the relevant sociolinguistic context, we would expect the medieval Latin/Irish contact situation to be a special type of non-oral borrowing scenario involving influence from a prestigious literary/sacral language on a developing standard vernacular. In such a scenario the expectations are for heavy lexical borrowing of nonbasic vocabulary items combined with minor borrowing of noninvasive structural items such as certain types of function words, new phonemes restricted to loanwords and high-prestige morphosyntactic construction types which do not affect basic syntax of the borrowing language. All proposals found in the literature for lexical and structural borrowing of Latin elements in medieval Irish are shown to fit into this general classification. However, closer examination of the proposals for structural borrowing reveals that most are better explained as having internal causes, either exclusively or at least additionally. Only borrowing related to the lexicon can be firmly established, confirming the claim that the role of Latin in medieval Ireland remained linguistically limited.

Historically, multilingualism was and is the norm in many parts of the archipelago, and common even in areas where one language dominates. The emergence of a unitary state with a national language after World War 2 has exerted pressure towards greater uniformity, but the shifts which are taking place are best viewed as changing patterns of multilingualism, rather than as shifts of large populations from one language to another. Such shifts in patterns of language use are occurring throughout the nation, and are resulting in threats to the viability of some languages, especially in the eastern part of the archipelago where there are many languages with small speaker populations. The size of the language groups in the east also has consequences for language maintenance. Although official policy recognises the right of different language groups to maintain their languages and cultures, resources for such activities are scarce and the large ethnolinguistic communities in the west, where several languages have speaker numbers in the millions, have been more successful in accessing resources and institutional support which assist language maintenance. In contrast, speaker groups in the eastern part of Indonesia have limited access to resources available for language maintenance, although recent funding initiatives by organisations based in Europe have at least assisted in drawing attention to the problems faced in that region.", "identifiers": {"isbn": "0748607730"}, "source": "Language", "authors": [{"first_name": "Social", "last_name": "Factors"}, {"first_name": "Language", "last_name": "Maintenance"}, {"first_name": "Language", "last_name": "Shift"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/language-maintenance-shift-death", "year": 2000, "type": "journal", "id": "f2d788a4-c401-30c5-aa5a-daceaa03016c"}, {"title": "Dialect In Aristophanes: the Politics of Language in Ancient Greek Literature", "abstract": "Did the Greeks find it amusing, irritating, or threatening when they heard another Greek speaking in a different dialect?

This follows directly from the fact that most current theoretical frameworks are not construction based, that is, they do not assume that constructions are form\u2013meaning correspondences.

In Old Irish, 'Contrast' and 'Exhaustive listing' are obligatorily marked, as it seems, by the cleft construction. In contrast the cleft construction is rarely attested in Old French, as there existed a free word accent, so focused elements could be highlighted either by prosodic means only or by word-order (sentence-initial position) + prosodic means.

SDB can increase cardiovascular disease risk and is correlated with hypertension. NFL players have a higher prevalence of hypertension, and we sought to determine the prevalence of SDB among players the NFL and the associations of SDB with anthropometric measures and cardiovascular risk factors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: NFL athletic training facilities from April to July 2007. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 137 active veteran players from 6 NFL teams. MEASUREMENTS: This evaluation of SDB among players in the NFL used a single-channel, home-based, unattended, portable, sleep apnea monitor. Multiple domains of self-reported sleep were assessed. Weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, neck circumference, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio, as well as blood pressure, cholesterol, and fasting glucose concentrations were measured. RESULTS: The mean respiratory disturbance index was 4.7 (+/- 12), with a median (interquartile range) of 2 (1,4). The prevalence of at least mild SDB (RDI > or = 5) was 19% (95% confidence interval, 12.8%-26.6%). Only 4.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.6%-9.2%) of participants had respiratory disturbance index of 15 or greater. Linemen and non-linemen were not different in their prevalence or severity of SDB. No single anthropometric measure was highly associated with SDB, and SDB was not well correlated with cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SDB in active NFL players was modest, predominately mild, and positively associated with several measures of adiposity. SDB did not account for excess cardiovascular risk factors.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "20550023", "isbn": "0161-8105 (Print)\\n0161-8105 (Linking)"}, "source": "Sleep", "authors": [{"first_name": "T B", "last_name": "Rice"}, {"first_name": "R E", "last_name": "Dunn"}, {"first_name": "A E", "last_name": "Lincoln"}, {"first_name": "A M", "last_name": "Tucker"}, {"first_name": "R A", "last_name": "Vogel"}, {"first_name": "R A", "last_name": "Heyer"}, {"first_name": "A P", "last_name": "Yates"}, {"first_name": "P W", "last_name": "Wilson"}, {"first_name": "E J", "last_name": "Pellmen"}, {"first_name": "T W", "last_name": "Allen"}, {"first_name": "A B", "last_name": "Newman"}, {"first_name": "P J", "last_name": "Strollo  Jr."}, {"first_name": "Health", "last_name": "National Football League Subcommittee on Cardiovascular"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/sleepdisordered-breathing-national-football-league-1", "year": 2010, "keywords": ["Adult", "Anthropometry/methods", "Blood Glucose", "Blood Pressure", "Body Mass Index", "Body Weight", "Body Weights and Measures", "Cholesterol/blood", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Football/*statistics & numerical data", "Humans", "Male", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Sleep Apnea Syndromes/blood/*epidemiology", "United States/epidemiology", "Waist Circumference", "Waist-Hip Ratio"], "type": "journal", "id": "36305498-8fbb-3896-a3e4-f355cdfa7f16"}, {"title": "England expects: English newspapers' narratives about the English football team in the 2006 World Cup", "abstract": "The essence of global sports has been competition among nations at the international level.

Using a qualitative textual analysis methodology, this study drew on Anderson's (1983) theory of the imagined community, Hobsbawm's (1983) notion of invented traditions, and the Eliasian (1991) concept of habitus codes. Set against the contemporary trends of devolution, globalization, and a post-7/7 discourse the newspapers relied on a reductionist, essentialist construction to elicit an emotional connection with a homogenous form of English national identity. The narratives seemed designed to galvanize support for the English team through references to historic English military victories and speeches. These served to rekindle images of bygone, mythical, and imperialistic eras.

We therefore undertook this work to examine the situation in our region. PATIENTS METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the French department 'Nord'. Different institutions in the health care network with facilities for caring for 2,668 elderly patients participated in the study. The day of the survey, we looked for persons over the age of 60 years with a certain or strongly suspected diagnosis of mistreatment. The data presented here concern only violence or neglect occurring in an extended family setting (family, friends, neighbors) and exclude all cases of violence or neglect occurring in an institutional setting. Data were collected using anonymous questionnaires filled out by professional teams working in the different institutions. RESULTS: Six percent of the study population had suffered mistreatment. In 76% of the cases, the mistreated person was a woman. Violence was the most frequently encountered situation, including psychological violence, although all forms were observed. Among the mistreatment victims, 77% showed signs of psychiatric or behavioral disorders and 95% were physically dependent. In 76% of the cases, the person responsible for the mistreatment was a member of the family. CONCLUSION: Mistreatment of elderly persons is a reality occurring frequently enough to be a major concern.

The contributions in this volume show that social class, one of the most powerful ways in which societies rank their members, shapes selves (or identities) and the interactions of these selves. Together, the chapters generate a set of new empirical questions, yet they also afford a number of broad generalizations about societal rank and social interaction. Across the research reported here, it emerges that people are constantly and keenly aware of their ranking and that those at the top of the social ladder think, feel, and act differently from those on the lower rungs. The essays in this volume reveal that social class influences all aspects of psychological functioning: how people make decisions; how they perceive and are perceived by others; their sense of self, agency, and identity; their feelings of trust, certainty, belonging, or fit; their orientation to time; their perceptions of health, sickness, and well-being; their social responsiveness to others; their understandings of in-group and out-group and social hierarchy; their attitudes toward politics, religion, and life in general; their hopes and dreams and possible selves. To understand how these psychological tendencies are constituted and maintained, the authors focus a wide-angle lens on behavior: ideas, institutions, interactions, and individuals.

The methodology identifies time series patterns, creates and transforms explanatory variables and specifies multilayer perceptrons for heterogeneous sets of time series without expert intervention.

In addition to the wind stirring and convective mixing, active in the upper pycnocline, the other important mechanism that results in limited ventilation of the anoxic waters of the Black Sea is the Mediterranean dense water inflow from the Bosphorus, modified by the entrainment of surface and intermediate waters, introduced into the interior through double-diffusive intrusions. This inflow, aided by the surface Ekman flux divergence, boundary processes and internal wave breaking, is the main mechanism for the mixing and renewal of the sub-pycnocline waters in the Black Sea interior. A review of these mixing processes is complemented by results from isotope measurements with improved accuracy and reduced noise compared to earlier experiments. Measurements of the stable isotopes oxygen-18 (18O) and deuterium (2H) confirm the origin of the water masses in the Black Sea and in the Turkish Straits, including the sea of Marmara, to be a continuous mixture with variable fractions of salty Mediterranean waters with inflowing fresh waters. Tritium (3H) measurements confirm very little penetration of the transient signal to the sub-pycnocline and deep waters of the Black Sea, in comparison to the better ventilated Mediterranean waters filling the lower layer of the Marmara Sea.

(1993/2008). O Estranhamento do Mundo (A. Nolasco, Trans.). Lisboa: Rel\u00f3gio d'\u00c1gua (Orig.: Weltfremdheit, 1993)  18 As mais significativas alus\u00f5es a um fundamento real para o achamento de si sem raz\u00e3o de indiv\u00edduos a meio do seu percurso vital, descobrimos em Otto Rank, aquele disc\u00edpulo de Freud, que desenvolveu a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o psicanal\u00edtica dos mitos, pela primeira vez, tomando-a uma real arqueologia do sujeito. Pensando ser apenas um aluno fiel do mestre, retirou as bases, desde logo, o esquematismo da an\u00e1lise cl\u00e1ssica. J\u00e1 em 1909, Rank antecipou a hist\u00f3ria primordial da subjectividade para muito antes dos dramas edipianos especificamente freudianos. A paleontologia do Eu de Rank retrocede at\u00e9 \u00e0 fronteira que separa a vida intra-uterina do ser humano da luz mundana do p\u00f3s-parto. O que Rank come\u00e7ou ent\u00e3o a descobrir significava nada menos do que o nascimento da subjectividade her\u00f3ica do esp\u00edrito a partir da oculta tentativa de infantic\u00eddio. Isto toma-nos atentos porque, enquanto os her\u00f3is representarem os prot\u00f3tipos da subjectividade aos olhos da hist\u00f3ria cultural, as suas hist\u00f3rias figuram na pr\u00e9-hist\u00f3ria de toda a vida, por prosaica que seja, que, no presente, diga Eu.  O breve texto de Rank sobre O Mito do Nascimento do Her\u00f3i parece ser, \u00e0 primeira vista, apenas uma daquelas in\u00fameras exegeses dos mitos que vagueiam pela terra de ningu\u00e9m, entre o rigor reflexivo e o descuido - e que, de resto, j\u00e1 h\u00e1 muito tempo n\u00e3o incomodam ningu\u00e9m. Na realidade, com Rank inicia-se a ruptura das an\u00e1lises mitol\u00f3gicas atrav\u00e9s da estratifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos   19  sintomas secund\u00e1rios e da sua interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o. Ele confronta-se pela primeira vez com a hist\u00f3ria real do primeiro Eu de come\u00e7o fr\u00e1gilmente estruturado e deixa em aberto o tema dos processos prim\u00e1rios'. N\u00e3o se trata ainda dos posteriormente conhecidos dramas das crian\u00e7as talentosas; Rank tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o fala directamente sobre a invis\u00edvel mortalidade das crian\u00e7as que hoje, no Primeiro Mundo, \u00e9 muito mais elevada do que a vis\u00edvel no Terceiro Mundo. A grande descoberta de Rank gira em tomo do drama da crian\u00e7a que escapou \u00e0 morte, que se salvou quase por milagre de um arcaico atentado \u00e0 sua vida e que, mais tarde, se p\u00f4s a caminho para se converter, de uma crian\u00e7a sobrevivente enjeitada, num sujeito em plena possess\u00e3o da verdade da sua proced\u00eancia. As hist\u00f3rias her\u00f3icas reunidas por Rank s\u00e3o, sem excep\u00e7\u00e3o, hist\u00f3rias de blocos err\u00e1ticos no sentido literal. O seu padr\u00e3o comum \u00e9 o abandono de rec\u00e9m-nascidos nas montanhas agrestes ou nos rios perigosos. A maior parte das vezes, os futuros her\u00f3is s\u00e3o objecto de inten\u00e7\u00f5es homicidas da parte do pai e da m\u00e3e. Ocasionalmente, s\u00e3o despotismos pol\u00edticos exteriores que for\u00e7am as m\u00e3es a abandonar as suas crian\u00e7as: pensemos nas lendas de Mois\u00e9s ou de \u00c9dipo. Estas hist\u00f3rias t\u00eam tamb\u00e9m em comum a sina da \u00absorte no meio do azar\u00bb. Atrav\u00e9s de um des\u00edgnio milagroso, interv\u00e9m um ser ben\u00e9fico - encontra-se uma abnegada m\u00e3e substituta, uma cabra, uma loba, uma ama, um aguadeiro, um pastor, um casal sem filhos. Estes assistentes providenciais salvam os blocos err\u00e1ticos do decl\u00ednio certo, levam-nos \u00e0s suas cavernas, \u00e0s suas casas, aos seus pal\u00e1cios, d\u00e3o-lhes alimento, roupa e nome e perf\u00edlham--nos at\u00e9 \u00e0 idade adulta. S\u00f3 depois desta holding - para al\u00e9m dos la\u00e7os de sangue e de todas as suas terr\u00edveis verdades - \u00e9 que come\u00e7a o terceiro acto da vida do her\u00f3i, que traz \u00e0 luz a individua\u00e7\u00e3o her\u00f3ica. Por um motivo qualquer, o futuro sujeito d\u00e1 com os tra\u00e7os da sua \u00abverdadeira origem\u00bb e do seu \u00abpr\u00f3prio sangue\u00bb assassino e remoto. O her\u00f3i segue o rasto que o leva de volta ao local do crime primordial. Assim se encontra de regresso \u00e0 cena do seu abandono, do seu violento alheamento. Mas, em virtude do texto m\u00edtico, a\u00ed descobre o seu verdadeiro des\u00edgnio. Converte-se no propriet\u00e1rio exemplar do t\u00edtulo que lhe tinha sido recusado de in\u00edcio. Ascende a sucessor do pai ou do soberano em todas as fun\u00e7\u00f5es; num caso famoso, inclusive at\u00e9 \u00e0 posse sexual da m\u00e3e - \u00e0 qual Sigmund Freud deu tanta import\u00e2ncia, que promoveu \u00c9dipo ao primeiro lugar de todos os her\u00f3is, apesar de a sua uni\u00e3o com a m\u00e3e constituir uma excep\u00e7\u00e3o, enquanto o abandono trai\u00e7oeiro pela m\u00e3e - ou, pelo menos, a sua separa\u00e7\u00e3o violenta e quase mortal - representa a regra.  Agora \u00e9 como se o anterior perigo vital tivesse dado espessura pela primeira vez \u00e0 vida do her\u00f3i e lhe tivesse posto no caminho a \u00e2nsia da ascens\u00e3o. O bloco err\u00e1tico, que retoma os seus direitos, toma-se um soberano carism\u00e1tico, um chefe e um defensor na sociedade dos homens; para mais, um redentor. \u00c9-se tentado a ver nisto uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o causal: justamente porque, ao  Para uma defini\u00e7\u00e3o mais precisa de \u00abprocesso prim\u00e1rio\u00bb, ver na parte 2 deste cap\u00edtulo as observa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre determina\u00e7\u00e3o e paix\u00e3o, p. 21.   20 princ\u00edpio, o her\u00f3i era uma v\u00edtima abandonada, \u00e9 ele que possui a motiva\u00e7\u00e3o emocional para, ulteriormente, se transformar num homem de ac\u00e7\u00e3o auto--suficiente. Quem 1er a sua hist\u00f3ria ouve a profecia de um acto posterior que nasce de uma dor passada. Neste sentido, tamb\u00e9m os mitos s\u00e3o muitas vezes prof\u00e9ticos. Enquanto hist\u00f3rias das autodescobertas dos her\u00f3is, preconizam que, de v\u00edtimas, se convertem em homens de ac\u00e7\u00e3o, e que entre os abandonados se recrutaram aqueles que, por \u00faltimo, se encontram a si mesmos e fazem valer os seus direitos.  Seguindo as refer\u00eancias de Otto Rank, no cerne das subjectividades her\u00f3icas descobrimos o drama de uma m\u00e1goa muito antiga que penetra em tudo. O que leva a si mesmos os her\u00f3is, os carism\u00e1ticos e profetas \u00e9 a mem\u00f3ria, sofrida silenciosamente, e ainda activa, de uma total \u00abcoisifica\u00e7\u00e3o\u00bb. Antes de qualquer reflex\u00e3o, a vida depara-se neles como uma dor total inamov\u00edvel. Ao her\u00f3i n\u00e3o d\u00f3i especialmente nenhuma parte do seu ser, exceptuando tudo. A\u00ed n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nenhum trecho que n\u00e3o entre em desespero. O motor da forma\u00e7\u00e3o do Eu her\u00f3ico \u00e9 a \u00e2nsia de se erguer totalmente do afundamento completo no oceano do desamparo. O her\u00f3i \u00e9 o homem que vem do mar do desamparo e que lan\u00e7a p\u00e9 a terra. Com ele tem in\u00edcio a aventura da civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o enquanto coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o da terra firme do Eu, viver e reinar no novo continente: arbitrariedade, poder, querer, saber. Por isso, os her\u00f3is s\u00e3o os pioneiros da cultura; eles desbravam a selva da impot\u00eancia e da confus\u00e3o. S\u00f3 na retaguarda dos her\u00f3is anteriores \u00e9 poss\u00edvel haver homens que se p\u00f5em a salvo aprendendo, de uma forma rotineira, o que na sua \u00e9poca \u00e9 pr\u00f3prio das possibilidades humanas. Deste ponto de vista, os her\u00f3is n\u00e3o s\u00e3o simplesmente sujeitos vigorosos com nomes sonantes; o seu Eu n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas um anexo da sua energia. Muito mais que isso, os her\u00f3is com toda a sua for\u00e7a n\u00e3o s\u00e3o outra coisa sen\u00e3o her\u00f3is do Ser-Eu, que lutam para que cada um se erga por si mesmo ao saber e \u00e0 conquista do pr\u00f3prio nome. Neste sentido, a heroicidade m\u00edtica \u00e9 sempre, desde logo, um protagonismo - porque a sua raz\u00e3o de ser \u00e9 a primeira luta contra a primeira derrota. Esta continua a ser, se bem que atenuada, a minha, a tua, a sua, a nossa e a vossa luta. \u00c9 t\u00e3o universal porque a experi\u00eancia do desespero infligida pela \u00abcoisifica\u00e7\u00e3o\u00bb abarca muito mais do que os casos de abandonos, francamente homicidas, dos rec\u00e9m-nascidos em elementos adversos. Desde que os homens come\u00e7aram a ser numerosos, tamb\u00e9m h\u00e1 muitas formas de atentados acidentais \u00e0 vida de crian\u00e7as e, do mesmo modo, muitas formas de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o e de descoberta de si mesmo no decurso n\u00e3o-her\u00f3ico da vida; in\u00fameras evoca\u00e7\u00f5es individuais e difusas dos mais profundos e antigos abandonos, sem que surja um contra--ataque her\u00f3ico^. Uma s\u00edndroma de sobreviv\u00eancia omnipresente em todos os oligoelementos forma a infra-estrutura nervosa da civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o mais avan\u00e7ada. A ele pertencem os necessitados de apoio e os toxic\u00f3manos, os manipul\u00e1veis e os irritados, os expectantes e os insubmissos, os furiosos e os mal- Ver as reflex\u00f5es de Otto Rank sobre a compensa\u00e7\u00e3o her\u00f3ica em Das Trauma der Geburt, Frankfurt a. M., 1988, pp. 118 e ss.   21  -humorados, os sedentos de salva\u00e7\u00e3o e os sonhadores. Todos eles mostram, em diferentes graus, tra\u00e7os de auto-hip\u00f3stases arcaicas. Por causa deles, e porque se tomaram muitos, o ressentimento pode, como Nietzsche perspicazmente notou, chegar a ser uma pot\u00eancia de primeira ordem; porque o ressentimento \u00e9 o sentimento dos sujeitos que se deparam no meio das coisas. Estes indiv\u00edduos s\u00e3o dados a si mesmos como dotes dif\u00edceis; para eles, a prenda da vida permanece envolvida numa cat\u00e1strofe difusa. No ressentimento reflecte-se o insuport\u00e1vel de uma exist\u00eancia, que est\u00e1 sempre a trope\u00e7ar nas consequ\u00eancias do seu violento abandono inicial. Por causa delas, tamb\u00e9m o Eu dos her\u00f3is e dos profetas \u00e9 originalmente aparentado com o dos sujeitos hipocondr\u00edacos e dos que sofrem enxaquecas. N\u00e3o s\u00e3o os hipocondr\u00edacos atletas do mau humor ou her\u00f3is do horror de si mesmo? Que s\u00e3o os trabalhos de H\u00e9rcules sen\u00e3o o correspondente oficial das doze lutas contra as perf\u00eddias da vida? N\u00e3o \u00e9 preciso a morte ser vencida sempre de cada vez, tanto na s\u00e9rie de proezas her\u00f3icas como na das hipocondr\u00edacas? Enquanto o her\u00f3i monol\u00edtico e positivo desenvolve a sua for\u00e7a contra-atacando o mundo inicialmente hostil, os neurast\u00e9nicos permanecem na sua vida amuada como enredados num perp\u00e9tuo combate in-decidido. O Eu hipocondr\u00edaco adere a si mesmo como os anacoretas no deserto \u00e0 sua natureza adversa.

Description of how to measure creativity in marketing; Blending of creativity with its ability to withstand repetition; Guerilla marketing. ------------------------------------------ Magazine: GOURMET RETAILER; JANUARY 2001 Section: Guerrilla Marketing Creative messages prevent marketing disasters When it comes to marketing, guerrillas become creative in very special ways and they're not the ways that are demonstrated by most marketing. Gourmet retailers can learn and profit when they learn these ways and become guerrilla marketers. Guerrillas view creativity in marketing the same way that drivers view steering wheels in their cars. The creativity is supposed to guide the marketing toward its goal of producing profits just as the steering wheel is supposed to guide the car toward its goal of arriving safely at the destination. It doesn't always work out that way. The bummer is that although there are tragedies on the highway because accidents happen, there are tragedies in marketing and none of them have to happen. Worse yet, they don't even happen by accident. People actually plan, sweat over, and focus hard upon marketing that is headed from the start directly toward disaster. Creativity in marketing is very different from creativity in the arts, although marketing is as eclectic an art form as has ever been devised by humankind. Marketing embraces writing, design, photography, video, special effects, music, dancing, and acting -- and yet its purpose is not that of the arts. Guerrillas view marketing with ten insights into marketing creativity that illuminates the path for them. These insights prevent them from going over the edge, losing their way, or wasting their time and money. Why wait? Here are the ten insights: 1. Creativity in marketing should be measured solely by how well it contributes to your overall profitability. If it helps you sell at profit, it is creative and if it doesn't, it's not creative. That makes creativity easy to measure. Awards and compliments have nothing to do with it. 2. Creativity should always be blended with its ability to withstand repetition because purchase decisions are made by the unconscious mind and repetition is the best way to access the unconscious. If your creative marketing idea can get stronger with repetition, you've got a winner. 3. Using creativity in marketing that resorts to humor is like reaching into a bag filled with poisonous snakes. Not only might you get hurt on your very first reach into the bag, but the more you reach, the more it works against you because repetition helps marketing but murders humor. 4. Creativity in marketing not directed towards motivating a purchase is like employing a vampire in your marketing. The vampire sucks attention away from your prime offer -- your benefits -- and your main idea in an inane attempt to be creative at the expense of your profitability. 5. Creativity should be seen as an opportunity not for show business but for sell business. Marketing is business far more than it is entertainment, and although it may be entertaining, that is not its prime requirement. It exists mainly to create a desire to buy, not to entertain. 6. Creativity is a way to implant your name and not an excuse not to mention it. Gain awareness and a crucial share of mind by showing and saying your name creatively, helping people remember your name the next time they're in the market for what you sell. 7. Creativity in marketing is the challenge of demonstrating your benefit in a way that people will remember. It is important that your prospects remember your name and equally important to know what makes you special and why they should own what you are offering. 8. Creativity comes not from inspiration or even perspiration. It comes from knowledge. The more knowledge you have, the more creative you can be. You require knowledge of your benefits, prospects, industry, competition, media options, and the Internet for starters. 9. Creativity begins not with a headline, graphic idea, special effect, or jingle; it begins with an idea. The idea should center around your offer, your competitive advantage, or your main benefit -- and it should come singing clearly through your marketing in any medium. 10. Creativity of the highest form in marketing has longevity and improves with age. How long has the Green Giant been ho-ho-ho-ing in his valley? Have United's skies been friendly? Has the Maytag repairman been lonely? Great marketing creativity is both flexible and enduring. It's a cinch to sit here in my comfy chair typing out a bunch of insights about how you should be creative. It's easy for me and hard for you. But hey, I've got my job and you've got yours. I'd like to tell you that it's going to be simple and that the list of businesses with timeless marketing creativity goes on and on. But I'd be lying because it's a short list. Amazingly brief. Most business owners have this ridiculous notion that their marketing is supposed to constantly change. And most people who create marketing have their eyes on their awards wall, not on your bottom line. So it's going to be a tough job for you to separate the true creativity from the pretend creativity. Most marketing you see these days is of the pretend variety. Still, armed with these insights, the creativity that you employ will be guerrilla creativity and will lead not down the garden path but directly to your bank vault. ~~~~~~~~ By Jay Conrad Levinson Jay Conrad Levinson is the author of the Guerrilla Marketing series of books, the best-selling marketing series in history.

This intuitively appealing idea provides the rationale for a large number of studies that have attracted much attention from scientists, clinicians and the general public. Unfortunately, most of this work presupposes that a functional effect has been established for the DNA repair gene polymorphisms under study. For XPD, there is no credible evidence for any effect on DNA repair of the two common polymorphisms leading to p.D312N and p.K751Q amino acid variations, and evolutionary analyses strongly predict that both polymorphisms are benign. Current evidence suggests no causal relationship between XPD polymorphisms, reduced DNA repair and increased cancer risk. We do not believe that more studies of the same kind will be useful. Instead, we suggest a combination of several other approaches, which up to now have been used in only a sporadic way, to examine more rigorously the possibility that phenotypic differences are associated with polymorphisms in other DNA repair genes. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Since DNA repair pathways remove radiation-induced DNA lesions and protect cells from lethality, these pathways represent potential therapeutic targets to radiosensitize tumors. In order to achieve a therapeutic gain, however, there must be a differential between tumor and normal cells that can be exploited to preferentially target the DNA repair of the tumor, while sparing surrounding normal tissues, and this has represented a significant challenge to progress. Nevertheless, recent advances in our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms and tumor biology, on both the biochemical and genetic levels, have identified molecular differentials that may increase tumor specificity. This mechanistic insight suggests new strategies for radiotherapeutic targeting of DNA repair.

Viruses also express proteins that perturb cellular DNA repair and cell cycle pathways, promoting tumorigenesis in their quest for cellular domination. This review presents an overview of strategies employed by viruses to manipulate DNA damage responses and cell cycle checkpoints as they commandeer the cell to maximize their own viral replication.

Key to these developments was the identification of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) as the central regulator of secondary Ab diversification, and the elucidation of its primary function as a DNA deaminase. Incredibly, current literature suggests the existence of a shared pathway, common to all secondary diversification processes, from which the separate outcomes branch outwards at various points. Immunoglobulin gene conversion (IGC) is one of these mechanisms and is used by a number of vertebrate species in both the development of the pre-immune repertoire and in affinity maturation. In a manner similar to other Ab diversification mechanisms, IGC has managed to co-opt a normal DNA repair pathway for the generation of receptor diversity. In the case of IGC specifically, that pathway is homologous recombination (HR). A burgeoning wealth of genetic, biochemical and structural data has clarified the roles of many key HR factors, allowing new insight into its molecular mechanism. These insights, combined with those from the common mechanism of AID action, synergize to develop an emerging picture of the mechanism underlying IGC. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

So wrote L. Frank Baum in the introduction to his popular children's story published in 1900. As fertile as his imagination was, Baum could hardly have conceived that his \" modern-ized fairly tale \" would attain immortality when it was adapted to the silver screen forty years later. Though not a smash hit at the time of its release, The Wizard of Oz soon captured the hearts of the movie-going public, and it has retained its grip ever since. With its stirring effects, colorful characters, and memorable music (not to mention Judy Garland's dazzling performance), the film has delighted young and old alike for three generations. Yet, as everyone knows, The Wizard of Oz is more than just another celluloid classic; it has become a permanent part of American pop-ular culture. Oz as Allegory Is Oz, however, merely a children's story, as its author claimed? For a quarter of a cen-tury after its film debut, no one seemed to think otherwise. This view would change completely when an obscure high school teacher published an essay in American Quarterly claiming that Baum's charming tale concealed a clever allegory on the Pop-ulist movement, the agrarian revolt that swept across the Midwest in the 1890s. In an ingenuous act of imaginative scholarship, Henry M. Littlefield linked the characters and the story line of the Oz tale to the political landscape of the Mauve Decade.

The story's enduring place in American cultural and film history is supported by the 13 Oz sequels Baum wrote in response to popular demand, the annual airing of the movie by television networks since the 1950s, and the successful contemporary Broadway production of \"Wicked,\" the backstory to the original production. The musical depicts Dorothy, a young girl discontented with her life on a rural Kansas farm, who is knocked unconscious during a tornado and dreams of a magical trip to a land called Oz, peopled with familiar faces from her life. Her journey ends when she realizes her own power to return home, and develops a new gratitude for her relationships in the waking world. The story lends itself to interpretation, and \"The Wizard of Oz\" has been viewed as an allegory for the American debate over the gold standard, adolescent sexual development, and the lesbian and gay movement's struggle for cultural acceptance. It has also been called a \"parable of injury, loss, and redemption\": \"when you have lost your brain, you might want to go on a journey to find a wizard to give you a new one.\" If extended further, this comment points to the film being a useful depiction of the complications and course of traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivorship. More specifically, Dorothy's dream of the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion accurately represents the three traumatic brain injury syndromes often experienced by brain-injured patients, namely, the syndromes of dysexecutive confusion, apathy, and disinhibition. We have found a usefulness in the famous \"Wizard of Oz\" story both for understanding and learning these complex clinical syndromes associated with TBI. The potential teaching value of The Wizard of Oz in brain injury lies not only in the representation of these specific syndromes, but also as an allegory for the rehabilitation from any brain injury. Brain-injured patients may find themselves in a strange new world after their injury, in which the people they know and places they remember are radically different, either because of the effects of neurological deficits, or due to the world's reaction to the patient's disabling condition. Glinda presents a powerful metaphor of focusing on capacity and potential, rather than on deficits, to maximize one's functions in the world and to overcome adversity. Remembering Dorothy and her helpful friends in the Land of Oz may give psychiatric practitioners the power to recall the frequently-encountered neurobehavioral syndromes of traumatic brain injury, and assist their patients toward functional and meaningful recovery.

The paper begins by locating its argument within Baudrillard\u2019s influential notion of the orders of simulacra, noting the neglected distinction between the imaginary and simulation (or hyperreality). It then moves into less familiar territory, exploring some of the least known aspects of Baudrillard\u2019s thought: symbolic exchange, destiny and radical otherness. These notions, we argue, not only suggest an alternative reading of the film, they also suggest an alternative perspective on Baudrillard\u2019s thought. Against standard views of Baudrillard\u2019s work as relativist, postmodernist and anti-feminist (Kellner 1989), the paper draws out a very different Baudrillard, one concerned with illusion, imagination and, perhaps, a singular form of ethicality. Our reading of the film, through Baudrillard\u2019s idiosyncratic writing on seduction, ritual and initiation, suggests an understanding of \u2018ethicality\u2019 as relational, radically contingent and subject to the play of destiny.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79952885915", "issn": "1466-4615"}, "source": "Film-Philosophy", "authors": [{"first_name": "William", "last_name": "Pawlett"}, {"first_name": "Meena", "last_name": "Dhanda"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/shared-destiny-radically-other-reading-wizard-oz", "year": 2010, "type": "journal", "id": "ef22606a-ad04-3a74-b130-ca308e25ffd7"}, {"title": "From 'The Wizard of Oz' to 'Wicked': Trajectory of American myth", "abstract": "The Wizard of Oz  story has been omnipresent in American popular culture since the first publication of L. Frank Baum's children's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  at the dawn of the twentieth century. Ever since, filmmakers, authors, and theatre producers have continued to return to Oz over and over again. However, while literally hundreds of adaptations of the Wizard of Oz  story abound, a handful of transformations are particularly significant in exploring discourses of American myth and culture: L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  (1900); MGM's classic film The Wizard of Oz  (1939); Sidney Lumet's film The Wiz  (1978); Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West  (1995); and Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman's Broadway musical Wicked (2003).                 This project critiques theories of fixed or prescriptive American myth, instead developing a theory of American myth as active, performative and even, at times, participatory, achieved through discussion of the fluidity of text and performance, built on Diana Taylor's theory of the archive and the repertoire. By approaching text and performance as fluid rather than fixed, this dissertation facilitates an interdisciplinary consideration of these works, bringing children's literature, film, popular fiction, theatre, and music together in a theoretically multifaceted approach to the  Wizard of Oz  narrative, its many transformations, and its lasting significance within American culture. In the process of addressing these myths, this dissertation explores themes consistent within these five versions of the Wizard of Oz  narrative, looking at the shifting significance and representations of gender, race, home, and magic in these works. These themes have been central to establishing the national identity of the citizen throughout American history; as such, their popular representations tend to reflect the values espoused by the surrounding culture at the time of creation. Therefore, a close examination of the recurring themes in these five versions of the  Wizard of Oz  story provides significant insight into the negotiation of these issues, their representations, and their corresponding moments in American culture.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "304845442", "isbn": "9781109060195"}, "source": "ProQuest Dissertations and Theses", "authors": [{"first_name": "Alissa", "last_name": "Burger"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/wizard-oz-wicked-trajectory-american-myth", "year": 2009, "keywords": ["0323:American studies", "0465:Theater", "0591:American literature", "0900:Film studies", "American literature", "American studies", "Communication and the arts", "Film studies", "Gender", "Home", "Language, literature and linguistics", "Magic", "Myth", "Performance", "Race", "Social sciences", "Text", "Theater", "Wicked", "Wizard of Oz"], "type": "thesis", "id": "086118d6-f8e8-3874-924b-052838536859"}, {"title": "Wizard of Oz prototyping of computer vision based action games for children", "abstract": "Table of Contents This paper describes the use of the Wizard of Oz (WOz) method in the design of computer vision based action games controlled with body movements.

The results also show that distinctive movement categories and gesture patterns can be found by observing the children playing games controlled by a human wizard.

Problems in the design of such a platform include the substantial number of agent controls needed and the flexibility required to represent the constructs of different theories, protocols and target environments as they are introduced and developed. These problems are addressed by augmenting a movie clip manager with a general drawing palette as a design tool. The result is a prototyping environment which simulates multiple agents on a desktop while allowing arbitrary notational conventions. The current version does not render multiple agents in a shared virtual environment, but the protocol-based architecture is amenable to such extensions. In the meantime, valuable results regarding the social character of multiple agent interaction can be explored with the existing tool.

The third principle has most recently been identified as internal selection and/or non-random phenotypic effects of mutation. It is shown that the genetic variance/covariance matrix of quantitative genetic theory measures developmental constraints due to internal selection and non-random mutation. The genetic variance/covariance matrix causes the response to selection to deviate from the optimal rate and direction as specified by the selection gradient, which measures direct selection on the phenotypes. Therefore, microevolutionary theory takes account of developmental constraints on evolution by natural selection through the genetic variance/covariance matrix.

An entire generation of Englishmen and Americans felt a deeper emotional involvement in that war than in any other world event of their lifetimes, including the Second World War. On the Continent, its \"lessons,\" as interpreted by participants of many nationalities, have played an important role in the politics of both Western Europe and the People's Democracies. Everywhere in the Western world, readers of history have noted parallels between the Spanish Republic of 1931 and the revolutionary governments which existed in France and Central Europe during the year 1848. The Austrian revolt of October 1934, reminded participants and observers alike of the Paris Commune of 1871, and even the most politically unsophisticated observers could see in the Spain of 1936 all the ideological and class conflicts which had characterized revolutionary France of 1789 and revolutionary Russia of 1917. It is not surprising, therefore, that the worthwhile books on the Spanish Civil War have almost all emphasized its international ramifications and have discussed its political crises entirely in the vocabulary of the French and Russian revolutions. Relatively few of the foreign participants realized that the Civil War had arisen out of specifically Spanish circumstances. Few of them knew the history of the Second Spanish Republic, which for five years prior to the war had been grappling with the problems of what we now call an \"underdeveloped nation.\" In Spanish Republic and the Civil War, Gabriel Jackson expounds the history of the Second Republic and the Civil War primarily as seen from within Spain. \u00a9 1965 by Princeton University Press.

It argues that the capacity of FC Barcelona and Real Madrid to articulate and reflect deeply rooted constructions of Catalanism and Spanishness has been transformed and distorted, with significant implications for both protagonists. These go to the heart of contested issues of nationhood within the vortex of a plurinational, democratic Spain. It critically examines the impact of the dominance of 'El Clasico' for the folkloric local and regional rivalries within La Liga and suggests that the globalization of the Real Madrid-FC Barcelona axis signals the erosion and demise of tradition in Spanish club football. \u00a9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84879609842", "issn": "1466-0970", "doi": "10.1080/14660970.2013.801263"}, "source": "Soccer & Society", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jim", "last_name": "O\u2019Brien"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/el-clasico-demise-tradition-spanish-club-football-perspectives-shifting-patterns-cultural-identity", "year": 2013, "type": "journal", "id": "1b596529-111d-3e79-8017-cdf1171710c0"}, {"title": "De kortstondige lotgevallen van de PEN-Clubs tijdens het interbellum in Spanje.: Een geschiedenis van politieke en regionale polarisatie", "abstract": "Three separate PEN Clubs were founded in Spain during the turbulent period between the wars. The first Spanish PEN Club met for the first time in the celebrated Madrid restaurant Lhardy on 5th July 1922, precisely nine months after the International PEN Club was set up in London. It did not have its own accommodation, but gathered roughly once a month in this restaurant under the chairmanship of the renowned writer Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz, better known by his pen-name of Azor\u00edn. It appears from the list of the club's members, which was published in November 1923, that this varied company included a number of prestigious authors such as D\u00edez-Canedo, Ramiro de Maeztu, Enrique de Mesa, Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Salaverr\u00eda. In addition, the Spanish delegation also aspired to an international profile by incorporating nineteen international honorary members at the top of the list of members, originating from Spanish-speaking America, Portugal and England. Although several regional authors joined this first PEN Club, remarkably enough there were only two Catalan writers on the list: Eugenio D'Ors and Angel Guimer\u00e1, the latter as an honorary member. There was a great deal of criticism of the snobbish nature of the banquetes, the costly feasts the members took part in at their own expense. One of the fiercest critics was undoubtedly Rafael Cansinos Assens, who not only denounced the elitist nature of the gatherings, but was also annoyed by what he considered the overly regional and national tenor that characterised the club. However, the fact that the club was less internationally oriented did not mean, inthe national context, that it reflected only one end of the ideological spectrum. The elitist nature of the club did not stop members with republican sympathies (such as Roberto Castrovido and Luis de Tapia) from joining. Journalists who had taken a critical attitude to the military campaigns in Morocco, such as Alfonso Hern\u00e1ndez Cat\u00e1 and Manuel Ciges Aparicio, also found their way to the PEN Club. Even someone like Julio Camba, at that time closely linked to anarchist circles, was a member. It is striking that there were also a substantial number of members from the Liga de Educaci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica, an association that Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset had set up and which was part of the liberal Partido Reformista. The founding of the first Spanish PEN Club in 1922 also coincided with the structural crisis the Ateneo Cient\u00edfico, Literario y Art\u00edstico de Madrid found itself in at about that time. It comes as no surprise that many of those in the PEN membership list in 1923 are also to be found in the January 1922 list of Athenaeum members. So the Spanish PEN Club was a valid alternative in the quest for a way of giving Spain's literary life a minimum of independence and social embedment. Spain's first PEN Club was not destined for a long life, however. Several reasons for this have been given over the years: the previously mentioned aristocratic nature of the club, the diversity of interests and poetics of its members, the lack of fellowfeeling among Spanish writers and the elitism of the Madrid writers with regard to authors from the periphery, especially those from Catalonia. But the increasing effect of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, who came to power in 1923, was also part of it. The same ideological polarisation and militarization had already led to the downfall of the Athenaeum in Madrid in 1924; a similar scenario was also to be played out at the German PEN Club in 1933. It was in 1924, two years after the Spanish club had been set up, that its Catalan counterpart came into being. On 7th January, in his capacity as chairman, the Catalan grammarian and liberal intellectual Pompeu Fabra sent out a letter in which he invited the Catalan intelligentsia to join the club. Although this letter emphasised that the PEN Club 'had no political or propaganda tenor whatsoever', it was obvious that cultural nationalism underlay the establishment of the Catalan delegation. Even before the club had been set up, its future secretary, Mill\u00e0s Raurell, was already pointing out, in a letter sent to the International PEN member Herman Ould on 11th January 1923, that the Catalan club had no connection with the one in Madrid. This new delegation wanted to represent the 'Catalan nation', which belonged to a different culture from its Spanish counterpart. The Catalan association possibly had an even harder time of it than the Spanish PEN Club under the regime of Primo de Rivera: under these circumstances, for example, it was out of the question to organise an international PEN congress in Barcelona. This did change, however. After the Catalan PEN Club had fallen into obscurity for many years, in 1934 it enjoyed a new boost, at the time of the Second Republic. In May of that year the club was re-established in the Athenaeum in Barcelona, which from then on served as the club's seat. The absolute climax of the activities of the Catalan PEN Club, however, was when the international PEN congress was held in Barcelona from 21st to 25th May 1935. It was the perfect opportunity to showcase the wealth of the Catalan artistic heritage and to give Catalan literature an international boost. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 put a final end to this glorious revival. The success of the international PEN congress in Barcelona was not to everyone's taste, however. In a newspaper article, Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna criticised the total absence of Spanish writers from the congress. The prevailing dissatisfaction was the main reason for setting up what was called the 'Second Madrid PEN Club'. The fact that this second Madrid - not Spanish - club developed in an extremely tense and polarised atmosphere hardly needs mentioning. Although there were still a number of republicans and liberals at the first banquet, such as Max Aub, Am\u00e9rico Castro, Tom\u00e1s Navarro Tom\u00e1s, Pedro Salinas, Luis de Tapia and Guillermo de Torre, their numbers steadily declined. The lists of participants at each of the feasts show that it was mainly writers with right-wing affinities (with all the shades of meaning that 'right-wing' implies) who attended. They included both adherents of Primo de Rivera's Falangism (fascists) (Fern\u00e1ndez Almagro, Manuel Machado, S\u00e1nchez Mazas) and more moderate right-wing intellectuals such as Baroja, el Conde de Romanones et al. As Miguel A. Iglesias has already pointed out in an article on this third PEN Club, this majority of right-wing intellectuals was an even more conspicuous presence since these right-wing movements were socially and politically in the minority during the Second Republic. The various Spanish PEN Clubs between the wars were neither the first nor the most successful attempt to unite Spanish writers regardless of their aesthetic or political tenor. In the 19th century the various liberal Athenaea were founded, as well as a considerable number of other associations that tried to defend the rights of authors, artists and musicians.

Recent studies in human fibroblasts have shown that ATM also regulates a mechanism of end-processing that is required for a component of double strand break repair. Human fibroblasts rarely undergo apoptosis after ionising radiation and, therefore, apoptosis is not considered in our review. The dual function of ATM raises the question as to how the two processes, DNA repair and checkpoint arrest, interplay to maintain genomic stability. In this review, we consider the impact of ATM's repair and checkpoint functions to the maintenance of genomic stability following irradiation in G2. We discuss evidence that ATM's repair function plays little role in the maintenance of genomic stability following exposure to ionising radiation. ATM's checkpoint function has a bigger impact on genomic stability but strikingly the two damage response pathways co-operate in a more than additive manner. In contrast, ATM's repair function is important for survival post irradiation. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, the genetic information has to be programmed. The epigenome serves as an interface between the dynamic environment and the inherited static genome. The epigenome is comprised of chromatin and a covalent modification of DNA by methylation. The epigenome is sculpted during development to shape the diversity of gene expression programs in the different cell types of the organism by a highly organized process. Epigenetic aberrations have similar consequences to genetic polymorphisms resulting in alterations in gene function. Recent data suggests that the epigenome is dynamic and is therefore responsive to environmental signals not only during the critical periods in development but also later in life as well. It is postulated here that not only chemicals but also exposure to social behaviour, such as maternal care, could affect the epigenome [1]. We speculate that exposures to different environmental agents could lead to inter-individual phenotypic diversity as well as disease and behavioural pathologies through epigenetic changes rather than changes to the genetic sequence. On the other hand inter-individual differences in the epigenetic state would result in differences in drug and toxin susceptibility through differential expression of DNA repair enzymes. It stands to reason therefore that mechanisms were developed to protect the epigenome from the deleterious effects of epigenomic damage. It also stands to reason that there is a crosstalk between the DNA damage repair machinery and the mechanisms protecting the epigenome. We will discuss here the current links between the regulation of the DNA methylation machinery and DNA damage responses and propose a unifying hypothesis for the mechanisms developed to protect our epigenetic and genetic identity of a cell. These have implications on or understanding how environmental agents exert their genomic damage, as well as on chemotherapeutics and toxicology. DNA should be understood in a wider context of damage to the genome as well as to the epigenome. DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS: The DNA molecule is chemically modified by methyl residues at the 5' position of the cytosine rings predominantly in the dinucleotide sequence CG in vertebrates [2]. What distinguishes DNA methylation in vertebrate genomes is the fact that not all CGs are methylated in any given cell type [2]. Distinct CGs are methylated in different cell types (between 60 and 80% of all CGs in a given cell type), generating cell type specific patterns of methylation [3]. Thus, the DNA methylation pattern confers upon the genome its cell type chemical identity [2]. The DNA methylation pattern is established during development and is then maintained faithfully through life by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase [4]. The DNA methylation reaction was believed to be irreversible, thus the common consensus was that the only manner by which methyl residues could be lost was through replication in the absence of DNA methyltransferase by passive demethylation [4]. Recent data supports the idea that similar to chromatin modification, DNA methylation is also potentially reversible [5] even in post mitotic tissues [6]. Recent results suggest that the DNA methylation pattern is highly dynamic in neurons and plays a critical role in memory and fear conditioning [34]. DNA METHYLATION, CHROMATIN AND GENE ACTIVITY: DNA methylation patterns in vertebrates are distinguished by their correlation with chromatin structure. Active open-configuration regions of the chromatin, which enable gene expression, are associated with hypomethylated DNA whereas hypermethylated DNA is packaged in inactive chromatin [2,8]. Recent genome wide analyses of DNA methylation patterns suggest a more complex relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression as was proposed two decades ago [3]. At a genomic level, promoters are poorly methylated whereas repetitive sequences and heterochromatic regions are methylated supporting the general role of DNA methylation in gene silencing [9]. Thus, although methylation is a long-term repressive signal, gene expression involves a combination of factors. MECHANISMS OF SILENCING OF GENE EXPRESSION BY DNA METHYLATION: There is now overwhelming data indicting that aberrant silencing of tumour suppressor genes by DNA methylation is a common mechanism in cancer [10]. Thus, there is no question that DNA methylation is a highly effective mechanism of silencing of gene expression in vertebrates and plants. DNA methylation silences gene expression by two principal mechanisms. The first mechanism involves direct interference of a methyl residue in a recognition element for a transcription factor with the binding of the transcription factor resulting in silencing of gene expression [11,12]. A second mechanism is indirect. A certain density of DNA methylation moieties in the region of the gene attracts the binding of methylated-DNA binding proteins such as MeCP2 [13]. MeCP2 recruits other proteins such as SIN3A and histone modifying enzymes, which lead to formation of a 'closed' chromatin configuration and silencing of gene expression [13]. ABERRANT DNA METHYLATION AND THE RESPONSE TO CHEMOTHERPAUTIC AGENTS: Interesting examples of genes involved in drug response which are altered by methylation are genes encoding mismatch repair functions such as hMLH1 which are hypermethylated and epigenetically silenced in a number of tumours [14,15]. Mismatch repair enzymes (MMR) are required for the toxic activity of some anticancer drugs. For example, loss of DNA mismatch repair contributes to resistance to cisplatin in human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells [16], a human colon cancer cell line deficient in hMLH1, was 2.1-fold resistant to cisplatin, a human endometrial cancer cell line HEC59, which is deficient in hMSH2, was 1.8-fold resistant to cisplatin [17], and ovarian cancer cisplatin resistant cell lines exhibit hyper-methylation of hMLH1 [18]. The degree of cisplatin resistance conferred by loss of DNA mismatch repair is sufficient to produce a large difference in clinical responsiveness in vivo [19]. The hMLH1 status appears to be highly correlated with the ability to engage cell death and cell cycle arrest after DNA damage induced by cisplatin [20]. Tumour cells with defects in MMR appear particularly resistant to alkylating and methylating agents [21,22]. In vitro resistance to 5-fluorouracil was also associated with methylation and silencing of hMLH1 [23]. Another example is the epigenetic silencing of 06-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT), which removes alkyl adducts from the O6 position of guanine. Loss of expression is rarely due to deletion, mutation, or rearrangement of the gene, but methylation of the CpG island of MGMT has been associated with the silencing of the gene in tumours and cell lines [24]. The responsiveness of tumours to alkylating agents is increased in tumours, which epigenetically silence this gene [25,26]. DNA METHYLATION AND DEMETHYLATION ENZYMES: The DNA methylation pattern is reversible. The DNA methylation reaction is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase(s) (DNMT) [8]. Methylation of DNA occurs immediately after replication by a transfer of a methyl moiety from the donor S-adenosyl- L-methionine (AdoMet) in a reaction catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). Three distinct phylogenic DNA methyltransferases were identified in mammals. DNMT1 shows preference for hemimethylated DNA in vitro, which is consistent with its role as maintenance DNMT, whereas DNMT3a and DNMT3b methylate unmethylated and methylated DNA at an equal rate which is consistent with a de novo DNMT role [27]. We have proposed a while ago that the DNA methylation pattern is a balance of methylation and demethylation reactions that are responsive to physiological and environmental signals and thus forms a platform for gene-environment interactions and a target for toxic agents [28]. There is a long list of data from both cell culture and early mouse development supporting the hypothesis that active methylation occurs in both embryonal and somatic cells. A replication-independent active demethylase was assayed in nuclear extracts from Zebrafish embryo [29]. A global active demethylation, which is independent of replication, occurs in the male pro-nucleus of mice shortly after fertilization [30]. Active demethylation was reported for the myosin gene in differentiating myoblast cells [31], Il2 gene upon T cell activation [32], the gene upon antigen exposure of memory CD8 T cells [33] and cinterferon in the glucocorticoid receptor gene promoter in adult rat brains upon treatment with the HDAC inhibitor TSA [6]. Recent data suggests rapid demethylation and methylation of specific genes in the brain in response to contextual fear conditioning raising the possibility that the DNA methylation is highly dynamic in neurons and that it plays a role in memory generation [34]. Thus, environmental agents could potentially affect the DNA methylation in both directions. If the hypothesis, which we propose is true, then it is important to consider the entire DNA methylation equilibrium as potential targets for toxic agents. It will also be important to consider the possibility that toxic agents might affect the DNA methylation pattern in nondividing tissues such as the brain or the heart as well as in dividing tissues. DNA DAMAGE AND DNA DEMETHYLATION CROSSTALK BETWEEN DNA AND EPIGENETIC INTEGRITY: The main challenge in the field is identifying the enzymes responsible for demethylation. This is especially important for evaluating the impact of candidate environmental toxins on DNA demethylation.

Several reports show that a tumor suppresser gene that is expressed in pancreatic carcinoma and related to malignant potential can induce apoptosis and also inhibit angiogenesis. At present, it is generally accepted that tumor growth in cancers, including pancreatic cancer, depends on angiogenesis. We have identified 2 new angiogenesis inhibitors from a conditioned medium of human pancreatic carcinoma cell line (BxPC-3): antiangiogenic antithrombin III (aaAT-III) and vitamin D binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-maf). These molecules were able to regress tumors in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice, demonstrating potent inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation.

Additionally, IFN-alpha- induced apoptosis occurred in cells from all cell cycle phases. Thus, we conclude that IFN-alpha-induced apoptosis seems to occur independent of cell growth inhibition. There were no changes in Bcl-2 or Bax protein levels that could account for the apoptosis-inducing effects of IFN-alpha in these cell lines. Moreover, examination of p53 status suggests that IFN-alpha-induced apoptosis in the U-266 and H9 cell lines occurs through a p53-independent pathway.", "authors": [{"first_name": "O", "last_name": "Sangfelt"}, {"first_name": "S", "last_name": "Erickson"}, {"first_name": "J", "last_name": "Castro"}, {"first_name": "T", "last_name": "Heiden"}, {"first_name": "S", "last_name": "Einhorn"}, {"first_name": "D", "last_name": "Grander"}], "source": "Cell Growth Differ", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/induction-apoptosis-inhibition-cell-growth-independent-responses-interferonalpha-hematopoietic-cell-2", "year": 1997, "keywords": ["*Apoptosis", "Bromodeoxyuridine/analysis", "Cell Cycle/drug effects", "Cell Division/drug effects", "Cell Survival/drug effects", "DNA/analysis", "Flow Cytometry", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects", "Human", "Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Protein p53/metabolism", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism", "Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Time Factors", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "type": "journal", "id": "39e5c448-b0c8-3fb1-81e9-58e2187b790c"}, {"title": "Flt-1 but not KDR/Flk-1 tyrosine kinase is a receptor for placenta growth factor, which is related to vascular endothelial growth factor.", "abstract": "Placenta Growth Factor (PIGF) is a new member of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. Although VEGF binds Flt family Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1 tyrosine kinases at high affinity for signal transduction, biological activities and the receptors of PIGF have not been extensively studied. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that PIGF-2, a subtype of PIGF-1 that bears a basic amino acid-rich domain, is more abundant than PIGF-1 and thus is the major subtype in human placenta. Using antibodies specific to PIGF-1 or -2 as markers, we obtained large amounts of PIGFs in the baculovirus expression system. PIGF-2 had growth-stimulatory activity on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and vascular permeability activity in the Miles assay at levels about 10-fold lower than those of VEGF. All PIGF-1 activities were lower than those of PIGF-2. Both PIGFs competed for the binding of 125I-labeled VEGF to Flt-1 receptor but not to KDR/Flk-1 expressed on NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, 125I-labeled PIGF bound to Flt-1 at high affinity but not to KDR/Flk-1. Supporting the notion that PIGF can use only Flt-1 as a receptor, PIGF activated Flt-1 to autophosphorylate, whereas PIGF could not generate signals from KDR/Flk-1. These results indicate that Flt-1, but not KDR/Flk-1, is a receptor for PIGF, suggesting that the weak biological activities of PIGF are due to its use of only part of the available VEGF signaling.

However, the mechanisms by which these genes are altered in metastasis remain unclear, since genetic alterations occur rarely, despite their widespread downregulation. Epigenetic alterations, and specifically CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing, can potentially explain the aberrant expression of many of these genes.

Recent studies have implicated epigenetic involvement throughout cancer progression, ranging from early pre-cancerous lesions through to the development of metastatic and drug-resistant phenotypes. The study of cancer epigenetics is therefore central to our understanding of cancer biology, as well as highlighting potentially new avenues of therapeutic intervention. A principal hallmark of cancer-associated epigenetic changes is aberrant methylation of CpG sites which leads to alterations in histone modification, chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. As such, hypomethylation of oncogenes, hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes and loss of imprinting are all involved in carcinogenesis. This chapter will focus on the range of analytical techniques that have been developed to profile both gene-specific and genome-wide methylation patterns in cancer. These methodologies are discussed in terms of the information they provide (qualitative vs. quantitative), their applicability to different clinical specimens (e.g. archival vs. fresh tissue), the common pitfalls encountered in their use and the various strategies employed for redressing these. The clinical implications of these analyses, such as their prognostic/diagnostic potential, are also discussed. \u00a9 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Also the family is the best place for nurturing human relationships and caring for children and the elderly. Both \"legitimate\" and \"de facto\" families must be recognized, and the emancipation of women requires a democratization of the family which implies equality and protects the exercise of free choice among its members. After drawing attention to earlier Recommendations, the Council recommends that the governments of member states base their preparation of family policy on specific proposals: 1) legislation should protect equality between the sexes and children's rights, pay attention to the problems encountered by spouses of different nationalities, contain policies on adoption and reproductive technologies, and be directed to eliminating domestic violence; 2) working life should have greater flexibility, including parental leave; 3) separate taxation should be enacted for spouses, a flat-rate child allowance should be introduced instead of tax reductions, and costs of caring for preschool-age children should be tax deductible; 4) social security should recognize the value of housework and child care, a minimum guaranteed income should be explored, individual rights should be established, people should be credited for time spent giving care to dependents, and the European Convention on Social Security should be ratified; 5) housing needs of families should be met and the infrastructures of towns should meet the needs of inhabitants, social infrastructure should help families care for elderly members; 6) equality of educational opportunity should be guaranteed for children from different backgrounds, single parents should receive assistance in rearing their children, and care structures for young children should be improved; 7) the consumption and information networks of family associations should be improved, and 8) migrant workers should be granted the right to have their families join them in host countries.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0024275657", "pmid": "12289698", "issn": "0364-3417"}, "source": "Annual Review of Population Law", "authors": [{"last_name": "Council of Europe.

For such, it was analyzed the Switzerland national football team during the FIFA World Cup 2014 tournament. Two general network metrics (total links and network density) and two centrality metrics (degree centrality and degree prestige) were computed. Four matches from Switzerland in FIFA World Cup 2014 were analysed in this study. A total of 334 adjacency matrices corresponding to 334 units of attack were generated based on the teammates' interactions and then converted in 4 network graphs. A total of 1129 passes were analysed. The greatest value of total links and network density was achieved in the first match (88 total links and 0.80 of density value). Degree centrality revealed that the defenders and midfielders were the players with greatest prominent values in the attacking building. Degree prestige showed that midfielders were the main targets of the team to pass the ball in the attacking process. In summary, this study showed that centrality metrics can be an important tool in match analysis to identify the style of play of football teams, revealing the most prominent tactical roles in the attacking process.

The histogram remapping technique is employed on the normalized image which remaps the histogram into normal distribution and thus it can improve the recognition performance. Experimental results on the Yale B and CMU PIE databases show that the proposed method can achieve satisfactory performance for recognizing face images under large illumination variations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Enhanced surveillance, based on Germany's pre-existing system of mandatory notifications was conducted between 7 June and 11 July 2006 in the 12 World Cup cities by: accelerating frequency of electronic data transmission of case-definition based notifiable diseases from weekly to daily transmission, additional reporting of non-case definition-based infectious disease events, lay and expert press screening and intensifying communication between all stakeholders of the surveillance system. Median delay of notification data transmission from the community to the federal level was reduced from three days to one day.

Brazil will host the 2014 Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. This paper represents the first results from Project \"Prepara Brasil,\" which is investigating the preparedness of the health sector and pharmaceutical services for these events. Hypothesis/Problem This study was designed to identify the efforts engaged in to prepare the health sector in Brazil for the FIFA World Cup 2014 event, as well as the 2016 Summer Olympics. METHODS: Key informant interviews were conducted with representatives of both the municipality and hospital sectors in each of the 12 host cities where matches will be played. A semi-structured key informant interview guide was developed, with sections for each type of participant. One of each municipality's reference hospitals was identified and seven additional general hospitals were randomly selected from all of the inpatient facilities in each municipality. The interviewers were instructed to contact a reference hospital, and two of the other hospitals, in the jurisdiction for participation in the study. Questions were asked about plans for mass-gathering events, the interaction between hospitals and government officials in preparation for the World Cup, and their perceptions of their surge capacity to meet the potential demands generated by the presence of the World Cup events in their municipalities. RESULTS: In all, 11 representatives of the sampled reference hospitals, and 24 representatives of other general private and public hospitals in the municipalities, were interviewed. Most of the hospitals had some interaction with government officials in preparation for the World Cup 2014. Approximately one-third (34%) received training activities from the government. Fifty-four percent (54%) of hospitals had no specific plans for communicating with the government or other agencies during the World Cup. Approximately half (51%) had plans for surge capacity during the event, but only 27% had any surge capacity for isolation of potentially infectious patients. CONCLUSION: Overall, although there has been mention of a great deal of planning on the part of the government officials for the World Cup 2014, hospital surge to meet the potential increase in demand still falls short.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84908242090", "pmid": "25007076", "issn": "1049-023X (Print)", "isbn": "1049-023X", "doi": "10.1017/S1049023X1400065X"}, "source": "Prehospital and disaster medicine", "authors": [{"first_name": "Kimberley", "last_name": "Shoaf"}, {"first_name": "Claudia G S", "last_name": "Osorio de Castro"}, {"first_name": "Elaine Silva", "last_name": "Miranda"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/hospital-preparedness-advance-2014-fifa-world-cup-brazil", "year": 2014, "keywords": ["Anniversaries and Special Events", "Brazil", "Disaster Planning", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Humans", "Mass Casualty Incidents", "Soccer", "Sports", "Surge Capacity", "organization & administration"], "type": "journal", "id": "9a329e02-c2e7-3ae1-b69f-d488db14c7b3"}, {"title": "Trading effects of the FIFA world cup", "abstract": "This study analyzes the trading effects of FIFA World Cup in two dimensions.

This technique, when programmed for digital computation using complex-arithmetic, or using hand calculation, provides the magnitude and direction of all the acceleration components, including the Coriolis term, automatically without resort to such crutches as a \"rule of thumb\" for determining whether or not the latter is present, \"traditional sign conventions\", and without the risk of using the wrong angular velocity.

Our extension relaxes some assumptions on the exponent, which is no longer required to be an integer. Using an axiomatic characterization of the exponential function, we show how to construct mappings that obey the same rules as exponentials, but can raise vectors to the power of other vectors in an algebraically sound manner. At the same time, computational hardness is not affected (in fact, the problem could possibly be strengthened).

But his early writings, the Two tracts on government, were composed in the period between 1660 and 1662 when the details of the church settlement were the subject of heated debate. The thought of the young Locke defended an uncompromising settlement which would rigidly enforce uniformity in religious worship and secure the restored monarchy from clerical subversion. Whilst scholars have previously focused on the changes in Locke's thought from royalist Anglicanism to whig toleration, this article focuses on the Tracts in their own right. By placing them in the context of the Restoration debate on adiaphora, ceremonial 'matters indifferent', the typicality or otherwise of Locke's early thought can be discerned. This article argues that the legalistic understanding of adiaphora meant that this debate touched on political authority and obedience as well as theological questions, not least because matters indifferent fell under the purview of the monarch as supreme governor of the church.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-26944479979", "doi": "10.2307/4091715", "isbn": "0018246X", "issn": "0018-246X"}, "source": "The Historical Journal", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jacqueline", "last_name": "Rose"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/john-locke-matters-indifferent-restoration-church-england", "year": 2005, "type": "journal", "id": "854c3007-c1e8-3cae-acac-a80c8150e9fb"}, {"title": "Edward VI", "abstract": "Fritze reviews \"Edward VI\" by Jennifer Loach and edited by George Bernard and Penry Williams.", "identifiers": {"issn": "00220469"}, "source": "The Journal of Ecclesiastical History", "authors": [{"first_name": "Ronald", "last_name": "Fritze"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/edward-vi-2", "year": 2001, "keywords": ["Biographies", "Edward VI, King of England (1537-53)", "England", "History", "Kings", "Nonfiction", "Religion"], "type": "journal", "id": "24bec5e8-914f-369a-a8d5-9e45f8c704f0"}, {"title": "Tudor Church militant.

For example, according to its press release, the game Iron Man 2 (2010) features \"a cast of characters that transports fans into a deeper and more authentic cinematic video game experience.\"1 And prospective gamers are informed that high-resolution digital scans and the motioncaptured movements of the cast of the Matrix trilogy ensured the highest degree of continuity between the films and video games.2 For all this promotional bluster, however, the reception of such figures has been mixed. In contrast with the acclaimed believability of the computer- generated Na'vi characters featured in James Cameron's movie Avatar (2009), the Na'vi characters that anchor Avatar: The Game (2009) were faulted for being \"stiff and awkward.\"3 A review of the character animation in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) observes that \"it's not easy to make Jessica Alba look unattractive, but (game developer) Visual Concepts has done it.\"4 Although the rendering power of the latest generation of PCs and gaming consoles may enable a strong visual correspondence between cinematic characters and their interactive incarnations, this correspondence seems to highlight the remaining disparities between the two media forms or invite accusations that movie tie-in games do nothing but slavishly ape the primary, cinematic text from which they are derived. As a result, these properties fail to become, in Henry Jenkins's terms, successful transmedia franchises, which succeed through their strategic distribution of key fictional elements (including characters, settings, and storylines) across multiple media channels with the intention that each medium will add its own, unique contribution to a larger franchise story world.5 Movie tie-in games have a long, storied history of disappointing film and video game fans alike, to the extent that the circa-1983 industry Crash has been widely (and, in many ways, fallaciously) attributed to the nowlegendary failure of one of the earliest and highest profile spin-offs: Atari's hastily developed version of E.T.: The Extraterrestrial (1982).6 However, for all that movie-licensed games have come to be viewed as a blight on both the film and video game industries at the time, this essay seeks to at least partially recuperate one facet of them: namely, their necessarily abstract approach to in-game player-character representation, the various diegetic and extratextual strategies employed to supplement this abstraction, and the resultant effect on both player identification and expansion/elaboration of the franchise story world as a whole. Mark J. P. Wolf has productively suggested that video games can be interpreted in terms of where they fall on the spectrum between two extremes, abstraction and representation: To abstract something is to simplify it, reducing it to a few essential basic forms instead of trying to reproduce it. Representation, which seeks to create resemblances and reproduce something, is the polar opposite of abstraction (and is sometimes conflated with realism). Most artwork falls in the spectrum between the two extremes, since even very representational art falls short of fully reproducing its subject.7 [italics in original] Abstraction was a necessary strategy in pre-Crash games, since, as Wolf points out, \"the video game began with perhaps the harshest restrictions encountered by any nascent visual medium in regard to graphic representation.\" 8 As this essay demonstrates, although the technologically imposed need for a high level of character abstraction limited developers' choices in creating appropriately cinematic player characters, it may have also freed early movie-game tie-ins from some of the challenges associated with translating more representational characters into the realm of the video game-challenges that even the most graphically sophisticated, latest generation of movie games are still dealing with as they seek to reproduce the photorealistic character aesthetics and behavior found in cinema. After all, while the drive to create ever more realistic game characters suggests that the ongoing refinement of avatar appearance and behavior is the key to greater player enjoyment of and investment in these figures, video game history suggests otherwise, especially when it comes to movie-licensed games. Building on Scott McCloud's assertion that cartoon characters function as a kind of vacuum into which our identities can be pulled-\"an empty shell that we inhabit which enables us to travel to another realm\"9-Wolf suggests that abstract game characters may perform a similar function for their users, creating a necessary gap between in-game character image and realist representation for players to inhabit, and thus \"become\" their character.10 Abstraction can become something that aids identification rather than alienating the player. As this essay shows, the marked gaps between early movie-game characters and their cinematic source material, in terms of both appearance and behavior, may have ultimately been crucial to naturalizing player engagement with them. Forced to strike a delicate balance between serving as an in-game stand-in for the player and bearing the visual and narrative associations demanded by their source medium, movie-licensed video game characters are avatars twice over-that of their operator and that of their film character. Pre-Crash movie-game characters succeeded because they were typically forced to prioritize the former over the latter. These pre-Crash games and their characters can teach us about the pervasive convergence between cinema and video games that has come to define our contemporary moment. As a kind of first wave of convergence between cinema and video games, these titles suggest that technological convergence-evident, for example, in the shared digital-imaging processes that have all but removed the aesthetic distinctions between film and game characters-may not be the ultimate determinant of successful converged content. If, as Jenkins argues, successful transmediation allows each medium to do what it does best, these early game characters may have been allowed to do what they do best by virtue of their necessary difference from, rather than their representational resemblance to, their cinematic counterparts. This essay's primary focus on movie-licensed games developed for home gaming systems reflects the marked prevalence of such titles for home consoles-evident, for example, in the extensive library of tie-ins developed for the Atari VCS console between 1978 and 1983.11 This was in part due to the greater re-playability of home games, as well as the lavishly illustrated manuals that accompanied them and \"filled in\" the meanings of their abstract graphics, which facilitated their depiction of the more complex characters and gameplay scenarios originating from film. \u00a9 2012 by Wayne State University Press.

Due to variation in workload and perceptual tolerance, power-awareness can optimize this power consumption significantly, thus facilitating migration to future power-constrained devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablets, wearables, phones etc. This work proposes such a low power system based on Approximate Graphics Rendering (AGR). The AGR system supports various algorithms and incremental changes to the computational mechanism based on certain pre-specified parameters. The knowledge available apriori about the signal and noise models of graphic images and Human Visual Perception (HVP) are used to select the configuration that meets the quality needs at the lowest power consumption. The power savings using the AGR system are examined for two power hungry stages of the 3D graphics rendering system, namely shading and texture mapping. Besides supporting various algorithms, two novel parameterizable computation schemes are proposed. First, iterative Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm based units are incorporated for certain computations. Second, a scheme for dynamically enhancing the perceived image spatial correlation for reduced computations is presented. A hardware synthesis and estimation methodology based on realistic graphics content from the well-known 3D graphics benchmarks and the game Quake2 is used for estimation of power savings. Significant power savings of 75.1%, 73.8% and 72% are demonstrated in the shading, texture mapping function blocks and CORDIC based 3D vector interpolator respectively.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-9144222179", "doi": "10.1023/B:VLSI.0000047269.03965.e9", "issn": "13875485"}, "source": "Journal of VLSI Signal Processing Systems for Signal, Image, and Video Technology", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jeongseon", "last_name": "Euh"}, {"first_name": "Jeevan", "last_name": "Chittamuru"}, {"first_name": "Wayne", "last_name": "Burleson"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/poweraware-3d-computer-graphics-rendering", "year": 2005, "keywords": ["3D Graphics", "Low-power", "Reconfigurable", "Shading", "Texture mapping"], "type": "conference_proceedings", "id": "c73c8d5a-c456-3c40-a4a0-4ebc1bd28f0a"}, {"title": "Modeling player experience in Super Mario Bros", "abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between level design parameters of platform games, individual playing characteristics and player experience.

The Muir family produced a variety of wood products for world-wide export and also opened a lumber yard in Victoria. On June 17, 1875 a bush fire, fanned by a high wind, set the mill on fire. It was rebuilt, relocated in 1879 and closed in 1892. The third steam sawmill on Vancouver Island was the Stamp or Anderson mill, at the head of the Alberni Canal. It was the largest lumbering enterprise undertaken on the Island in the Crown Colony period. On June 29, 1860, the schooner Meg Merrilies landed nine workmen at the head of the Alberni Canal, to make preparations for the new settlement. Two months later the schooner Woodpecker arrived from England, bringing six additional workmen, the machinery for the mill, and general merchandise. On May 22, 1861, the new sawmill got up steam for the first time. As with the Muir operation, exports went world-wide and the local market was also important. In November, 1862 Stamp & Company was succeeded by Anderson & Company. Due to logistical problems in getting timber to the mill, the sawmill closed either in December of 1864, or early in January, 1865. The settlement was practically abandoned three months later. In June, 1868 it was announced that the machinery in the sawmill had been sold to the Puget Mill Company. The remaining buildings stood derelict until being destroyed by fire in 1879. Other sawmills on Vancouver Island were located around Victoria, at Mill Bay, Chemainus and Nanaimo. The story of lumbering in the old Crown Colony of Vancouver Island ends in a period of stress and depression. The Alberni mill was closed, permanently as it proved, and lumber exports had fallen to negligible proportions. Burrard Inlet, on the Mainland, where S.P. Moody had taken over the Burrard Inlet Mills, was destined for some years to be the only important lumber exporting centre in the new united Colony of British Columbia.", "authors": [{"first_name": "W K", "last_name": "Lamb"}], "source": "British Columbia Historical Quarterly", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/early-lumbering-vancouver-island-part-218551866", "year": 1938, "keywords": ["logging", "sawmills", "vancouver_island"], "type": "journal", "id": "d58ad3df-0178-31ef-b681-62d52e03f278"}, {"title": "the Battle of Britain", "abstract": "From the award-winning author of The Dictators, Richard Overy's The Battle of Britain: Myth and Reality is the best introduction available to a defining moment in British history.

After the Castilian conquest of Seville in 1248 and the submission of the Muslim kingdom of Granada as a vassal state, the Moors no longer loomed as a threat and the reconquest seemed to be over. Still, in the following century, the Castilian kings, prompted by ideology and strategy, attempted to dominate the Strait. As self-proclaimed heirs of the Visigoths, they aspired not only to reconstitute the Visigothic kingdom by expelling the Muslims from Spain but also to conquer Morocco as part of the Visigothic legacy. As successive bands of Muslims over the centuries had crossed the Strait from Morocco into Spain, the kings of Castile recognized the strategic importance of securing Algeciras, Gibraltar, and Tarifa, the ports long used by the invaders. At a time when European enthusiasm for the crusade to the Holy Land was on the wane, the Christian struggle for the Strait received the character of a crusade as papal bulls conferred the crusading indulgence as well as ancillary benefits. The Gibraltar Crusade had mixed results. Although the Castilians seized Gibraltar in 1309 and Algeciras in 1344, the Moors eventually repossessed them. Only Tarifa, captured in 1292, remained in Castilian hands. Nevertheless, the power of the Marinid dynasty of Morocco was broken at the battle of Salado in 1340, and for the remainder of the Middle Ages Spain was relieved of the threat of Moroccan invasion. While the reconquest remained dormant during the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last Muslim outpost in Spain, in 1492. In subsequent years Castile fulfilled its earlier aspirations by establishing a foothold in Morocco. \u00a9 2011 by the University of Pennsylvania Press.

It is based on hundreds of interviews of men who fought there, including North Vietnamese commanders. In November 1965, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, under Lt. Col. Hal Moore's command, were dropped by helicopter into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was chopped to pieces. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the Vietnam War's most significant battles. How these men persevered makes a vivid portrait of war at its most inspiring and devastating. General Moore and Joseph Galloway, the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting, have interviewed hundreds of men who fought there, including the North Vietnamese commanders. This dramatic account presents a picture of men facing the ultimate challenge and dealing with it in ways they would have found unimaginable only a few hours earlier.

The latter year promised a sequence of endings -- communism, the French Revolution, history itself. More than the Berlin Wall was supposed to come down. Every gesture of the twentieth-century demurral against capitalism would also disappear. While the movement against state control over the economy had been gaining ground since the middle 1970s, it was only after the Soviet Empire collapsed that Western political leaders declared \"the era of big government\" over.Now, unbridled free market capitalism would be the one true form of social organization. Elites and intellectuals would go on to lose all historical memory -- of the IWW, the sit-down strikes of 1937, the creation of the modern welfare state. Or, if remembered, they would be recalled as fitful episodes in the long nightmare of social democracy from which we awoke in 1989. The Battle in Seattle may have changed all that -- and not just in the minds of romantic leftists. For the first time in perhaps a half-century, the \"labor question\" is back on the table: In this new global economy, people are asking, what will be the status of those who sweep the floors, stitch the clothes, mine the ore, empty the bedpans, answer the phones, enter the data, and, increasingly, heal the patients and teach the students? Does the extension of capitalism American-style automatically translate into benefits for those who have little or no capital, and must work to survive? While workers have been protesting the downsizing of industrial capitalism and the rise of leaner, meaner forms of production for more than a quarter-century, their protests have usually gone unheard. The media has focused on workers' discontent only when their banner has been raised by the likes of Patrick Buchanan. Now people may be listening, not just here but throughout the world. For Seattle has managed to reignite debates about the relationship between markets and states as few events have. Rather than reaffirm the marriage of capitalism and democracy, the post-communist era is now poised for a reconsideration of their perilous relationship. In the words of William Daley, US Secretary of Commerce, after Seattle, \"things will never be the same.\"[1]  I advance here two arguments about politics and theory, post-Seattle. First, the conflicts over the global economy which erupted last December are best understood as struggles against corporate capital. Against the pundits and intellectuals who insist that Seattle-style protests arise from collisions between internationalists and nationalists, I argue that the protestors are inspired by an internationalist ethic and a hostility to the unrestrained power that corporate capital has assumed since the 1970s. Their goal is not to erect higher fences along borders nor is it to affirm local autonomy or particularistic identities. Rather, they seek to stop corporations and banks from pitting different groups, laws, and countries against each other in the quest for the cheapest labor, the least restrictive environmental protections, the most opaque forms of political governance. Second, the terms and categories of much contemporary political theory have made it difficult for us to see, much less understand, this internationalist, anti-corporate politics. Over the last few decades, but particularly since the collapse of communism, we have come to believe that struggles over the economy are a thing of the past. Today's politics is supposed to be about the assertion and denial of ethnic or other forms of identity, the degree to which states approximate a cohesive cultural unit, whether our obligations extend beyond a narrow perimeter of community affiliation to encompass the globe itself. Commentators and political theorists on the left and right have assumed that the struggle between capital and democracy has been settled, that conflicts over identity are the paramount forms of political contest, and that membership, loyalty, affiliation, and obligation are the complete vocabularies of those engagements.

He also explores the changing influences on our responses to these finds, by examining the impact of Egyptology on various aspects of popular culture such as literature, cinema, opera, and contemporary art. He considers all aspects of ancient Egyptian culture, from tombs and mummies to the discovery of artefacts and the decipherment of hieroglyphs, and from despotic pharaohs to animal-headed gods.

A change in climate in that time was expressed firstly by aridification and low floods of the Nile, but also by occasional heavy rainfalls in northern Egypt. Low Nile floods were probably a consequence of decreased summer precipitation in the Ethiopian Highlands that resulted in catastrophically low discharges into the Blue Nile drainage basin. These weaker summer monsoons in Ethiopia and gradual aridification in Egypt that started about 5000cal BP, were coincident with a southward progressing shifting of the summer Intertropical Convergence Zone in Africa. Simultaneous intensive rainfalls resulted in wide-spread sheet-flood accumulations, attested by archaeological evidence in northern Egypt. These rainfalls could be triggered by the North Atlantic Oscillation. Both these reasons caused a rapid collapse of the Old Kingdom at about 4200cal BP. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84903368161", "issn": "10406182", "isbn": "1040-6182", "doi": "10.1016/j.quaint.2013.07.035"}, "source": "Quaternary International", "authors": [{"first_name": "Fabian", "last_name": "Welc"}, {"first_name": "Leszek", "last_name": "Marks"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/climate-change-end-old-kingdom-egypt-around-4200bp-new-geoarchaeological-evidence", "year": 2014, "type": "journal", "id": "83b82c14-60cd-3955-9ff2-17b8a1ac9a01"}, {"title": "The Middle Kingdom in Egypt", "abstract": "AEB 1995.0452  The article is included in part 5: History and Culture.

Basalt, which was used in predynastic times for stone vessels, is frequently seen as a paving material in royal mortuary complexes and for royal sarcophagi in the Old Kingdom. Whereas the earlier production probably involved only the use of small blocks found loose at outcroppings, the demand for basalt in the Old Kingdom necessitated quarrying. This contribution documents a recently discovered basalt quarry, to date the only one known from the Old Kingdom, at Widan el-Faras in the northern Faiyum, and presents the geological and petrographic characteristics of the basalt found there. Also included are descriptions of the quarry itself, a workmen's settlement, and a paved quarry road leading to Lake Moeris. Because the stone that was quarried at Widan el-Faras was not of the highest quality, the authors suggest that basalt used for royal sarcophagi came from elsewhere. Surviving paving stones of the quarry road are in very good condition, and the authors hypothesize that they were protected from wear by wooden beams when the basalt blocks were dragged from the quarry with sledges. They propose that the blocks were loaded onto boats on Lake Moeris, which in the Old Kingdom was far larger and deeper than in later ancient and modern times, from a quay built from a natural ridge reinforced with an artificial fill of lake sediments, and shipped from there to the Nile through the Lahun-Hawara gap during flood season.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84864098033"}, "source": "Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt", "authors": [{"first_name": "James A", "last_name": "Harrell"}, {"first_name": "Thomas M", "last_name": "Brown"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/old-kingdom-basalt-quarry-widan-elfaras-quarry-road-lake-moeris", "year": 1995, "keywords": ["Egypt (Widan el-Faras)", "Old Kingdom", "basalt", "provenance (source)", "quarries"], "type": "journal", "id": "f8cd62ec-26ed-37b6-82a7-1c72fb2566e2"}, {"title": "Old Kingdom copper smelting artifacts from Buhen in Upper Egypt.", "abstract": "Artifacts from an early copper smelter were collected during an archaeological investigation of the Old Kingdom town of Buhen in Upper Egypt.

This research gathers the references to dreams from this period and analyzes them philologically according to genre. As the focus is on the Egyptians' own perceptions of their dreams, only sources written in ancient Egyptian are considered, and these are included in transliteration and translation in the appendix. The study begins with an overview of theories of dreams--including prior theories regarding dreams in pharaonic Egypt, synopses of diverse theories from the fields of psychology, anthropology, cultural history, and their relevance to the topic of dreams in ancient Egypt, and cross-cultural comparisons. The second chapter includes an analysis of the lexemes used for dreams, their etymology, what they reveal about the Egyptians' conception of dreams, and new interpretations and additions to our lexicon. This is followed by sources revealing a perception of dreams as a physical space, and the significance of time in dreams. Chapter three examines the function of dreams as literary devices in belles-lettres , as manifestations of cultural views, and their use by pharaohs in political texts. A new translation of the New Kingdom DreamBook and re-evaluation of the progression of the importance of dream interpretation is the focus of chapter four. Chapter five explores the religious significance of dreams, their usefulness as indicators of the evolution of personal piety, and their possible role in the \"Opening of the Mouth\" ritual. The last chapter investigates references to nightmares and notes their rise in prominence which reflects Egypt's changing status within the ancient world.

While his status as an important intellectual figure declined following his death, a resurrection of his works began in the latter half of the twentieth century. This renewed interest in Malebranche's thought was certainly promoted by the publication and subsequent wide availability of his complete works in the original French (20 volumes published between 1958 and 1984), and several translations, most notably of Malebranche's magnum opus The Search After Truth, which served to make the philosopher more accessible to the English-speaking world. The push to establish Malebranche as a valuable figure in the history of philosophy is well motivated. His collected works illustrate a careful and unorthodox synthesis of the philosophies of Saint Augustine (see AUGUSTINE, SAINT) and Ren\u00e9 Descartes that exercised many of Malebranche's contemporaries, the reactions of whom (often in the form of zealous objection) are found in correspondence and volumes of published works. Malebranche's influence on eighteenth-century British philosophy in particular has been well chronicled (McCracken 1983). Given his range of influence and his unique system, it is no longer idiosyncratic to affirm that a familiarity with Malebranche's views is critical for an understanding of the evolution of philosophical thought through the early modern period and beyond (see EARLY MODERN ETHICS).", "identifiers": {"doi": "10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee464", "isbn": "9781444367072"}, "source": "International Encyclopedia of Ethics", "authors": [{"first_name": "Julie", "last_name": "Walsh"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/malebranche-nicolas-1", "year": 2013, "keywords": ["history of philosophy", "philosophy", "responsibility", "sin", "virtue"], "type": "book_section", "id": "040badc6-c8ea-3f37-bd1a-06f5089ea8b1"}, {"title": "The Mystery of David Chalmers", "abstract": "\u2018The Singularity\u2019 is a remarkable text, in ways that many readers may not appreciate.

It is shown that Edwards and Malebranche were in very close agreement on ontological questions pertaining to the Trinity, both with respect to the internal, triune nature of the divine substance (characterising the Three Persons as the divine power, as the consubstantial idea of God which was generated as He eternally reflected on Himself, and as the mutual love which proceeded between the Father and this idea), and also with respect to the various roles these Three Persons played in the creation of the world. In epistemology, Malebranche postulated an illuminating union between the mind of man and the divine Word, insisting on an absolutely direct involvement of the Second Person in all human cognition, both intellectual and sensible. On this point Edwards did differ, endorsing instead an empiricist epistemology which left no room for such a direct union with the Word. However, when it came to ethics, Edwards and Malebranche both gave the Third Person an utterly central role, postulating much the same kind of union as Malebranche alone had postulated in the epistemological case, only now between the will of man and the Holy Spirit.

Chalmers constructs a highly ambitious and original picture of the world, from a few basic elements. He develops and extends Rudolf Carnap's attempt to do the same in Der Logische Aufbau Der Welt (1928). Carnap gave a blueprint for describing the entire world using a limited vocabulary, so that all truths about the world could be derived from that description--but his Aufbau is often seen as a noble failure. In Constructing the World, Chalmers argues that something like the Aufbau project can succeed. With the right vocabulary and the right derivation relation, we can indeed construct the world. The focal point of Chalmers's project is scrutability: roughly, the thesis that ideal reasoning from a limited class of basic truths yields all truths about the world. Chalmers first argues for the scrutability thesis and then considers how small the base can be. All this can be seen as a project in metaphysical epistemology: epistemology in service of a global picture of the world and of our conception thereof. The scrutability framework has ramifications throughout philosophy. Using it, Chalmers defends a broadly Fregean approach to meaning, argues for an internalist approach to the contents of thought, and rebuts W. V. Quine's arguments against the analytic and the a priori. He also uses scrutability to analyze the unity of science, to defend a conceptual approach to metaphysics, and to mount a structuralist response to skepticism. Based on Chalmers's 2010 John Locke lectures, Constructing the World opens up debate on central areas of philosophy including philosophy of language, consciousness, knowledge, and reality.

We find that the award of sanctions by Spanish referees in the Champions League are not significantly different to those of the referees from other countries and as such are subject to the same sources of bias. In Primera Liga matches where the crowd is separated from the pitch by running tracks, we find that the probability of the award of a yellow card to the home team is higher and that of the away team is lower compared to matches played at stadia without running tracks. Similar results are found in the Champions League, where efforts are made to hire neutral referees. Referee behavior is also influenced by the size of the crowd in attendance.

Variables with negative effects are: the punishment of the teams, measured by own yellow and red cards per fouls committed, or simply the red cards, the shots wide, the corners, the ball possession and its difference, and how smart the defenders are playing, measured by the number of the opposite teams' offsides per own ball possession. In addition, the multinomial logistic regressions show that differences in some match statistics and the ranking of the teams explain 9 out of 10 home victories and almost 6 out of 10 home defeats. Finally, one of the strongest explanatory variables, the positive difference in shots on goal, compared to equality in shots on goal between teams, leads to a probability of a home team victory by 66%.

Fifty-four male and fifty-nine female soccer players were tracked during UEFA Champions League matches using a multi-camera system (Amisco, Nice, France). Male players covered more (P<.01) distance than female players in total during a match (Effect Size [ES]: 0.5) and at higher speed thresholds (>15, >18, 18-21, 21-23, 23-25 and >27kmh-1; ES: 0.7-1.4). Decrements in the second versus first half (P<.01) were only evident in female players for the distance covered in total and at selected speed thresholds (12-15, >12 and >15kmh-1; ES: 0.6). Male central midfielders covered more (P<.01) total distance during a match than female central midfielders and at selected speed thresholds (15-23kmh-1; ES: 1.3-2.2). Male full-backs and wide midfielders covered a greater distance (P<.01) than female players in the same positions at higher speed thresholds (>15, 21-23, 23-25, 25-27 and >27kmh-1; ES: 1.5-3.1). The distance covered during the most intense 5min period of the match (>15kmh-1) was higher (P<.01) in male compared to female players (ES: 1.0) but no distance deficit in the next versus the average 5min period was observed for either gender (ES: 0.1-0.2). No gender differences were found for technical events such as the number of ball touches, time in possession of the ball or total duels won during both halves and the entire match (ES: 0.1-0.3). However, female players lost the ball more often (P<.05) and displayed lower pass completion rates than male players during both halves and the entire match (ES: 0.5-0.9). The data demonstrate that large gender differences exist for match performance characteristics of players competing at the highest competitive standard of European soccer. Such detailed analyses could be useful for gender-specific training information for optimal preparation. However, more research is warranted to establish gender-specific speed thresholds for elite soccer players. \u00a9 2013.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "24139663", "issn": "01679457", "isbn": "1872-7646; 0167-9457", "doi": "10.1016/j.humov.2013.07.024"}, "source": "Human Movement Science", "authors": [{"first_name": "Paul S.", "last_name": "Bradley"}, {"first_name": "Alexandre", "last_name": "Dellal"}, {"first_name": "Magni", "last_name": "Mohr"}, {"first_name": "Julen", "last_name": "Castellano"}, {"first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Wilkie"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/gender-differences-match-performance-characteristics-soccer-players-competing-uefa-champions-league", "year": 2014, "keywords": ["Fatigue", "Gender differences", "Match performance"], "type": "journal", "id": "1ea6ed54-ea5f-381d-ac3d-297f942febe0"}, {"title": "NATURE METHODS", "abstract": "DNA containing a new unnatural base pair may be amplified by PCR and transcribed into RNA, potentially increasing the diversity available from nucleic acids.", "identifiers": {"doi": "10.1038/nmeth.1770", "isbn": "1548-7091"}, "source": "Amplify this!

This analysis shows that in DNA crystals, tight DNA-DNA interactions destabilize the double helices at various degrees, from the alteration of the base-stacking to the opening of the base-pairs. The electrostatic repulsion generated by the DNA close approach of the negatively charged sugar phosphate backbones may therefore provide a potential source of the energy required for DNA melting. These observations suggest a new molecular mechanism for the initial steps of strand separation in which the coupling of the DNA tertiary and secondary interactions both actively triggers the base pair opening and stabilizes the intermediate states during the melting pathway.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "23060287", "issn": "1420-3049", "isbn": "3349182542", "doi": "10.3390/molecules171011947"}, "source": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "authors": [{"first_name": "Youri", "last_name": "Timsit"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/dnadirected-base-pair-opening", "year": 2012, "keywords": ["Base Pairing", "DNA", "DNA Replication", "DNA Replication: physiology", "DNA: chemistry", "Models, Biological", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Nucleic Acid Denaturation"], "type": "journal", "id": "0402bd74-9737-3e90-9f69-5dc25b28a9c7"}, {"title": "Sequence-dependent base pair opening in DNA double helix.", "abstract": "Preservation of genetic information in DNA relies on shielding the nucleobases from damage within the double helix.

Prediction of sequence-dependent basepair opening probabilities in DNA is based on separation of the two major contributions to the stability of the double helix: lateral pairing between the complementary bases and stacking of the pairs along the helical axis. The partition function calculates the basepair opening probability at every position based on the loss of two stacking interactions and one base-pairing.

Recent studies with the analog altromycin B have determined that these agents intercalate into the DNA molecule, position carbohydrate substituents into both major and minor grooves, and alkylate the DNA molecule by epoxide-mediated electrophilic attack on N7 of guanine located to the 3' side of the drug molecule. Alkylation is sequence dependent and appears to be modulated by glycoside substituents attached at the corners of a planar chromophore. The altromycin B-like analogs preferentially alkylate 5'AG sequences; hedamycin-like analogs prefer 5'TG and 5'CG sequences. Although the mechanism of guanine modification by altromycin B has been extensively studied, the mechanism of action of hedamycin has not been previously determined.\\n\\nRESULTS: Using high-field NMR, we have shown that hedamycin stacks to the 5' side of the guanine nucleotide at the site of intercalation in a DNA decamer, positioning both aminosaccharides into the minor groove to direct alkylation by the epoxide moiety on N7 of guanine. The C10 linked N,N-dimethylvancosamine sugar moiety interacts to the 5' side of the intercalation site, while the C8 linked anglosamine moiety interacts to the 3' side. The binding interactions of the two aminosugars steer the C2 double epoxide located in the major groove into the proximity of N7 of guanine. Unexpectedly, it is not the first epoxide that undergoes electrophilic addition to N7 of guanine, which would correspond to altromycin B, but the second, terminal epoxide.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We have used two-dimensional NMR to elucidate the sequence-selective recognition of DNA by hedamycin and the mechanism of covalent modification of guanine by this antibiotic. Characterization of the intermolecular interactions between both hedamycin and altromycin B and their targeted DNA sequences has yielded a better understanding of the reasons for variations in sequence selectivity and alkylation reactivity among the pluramycin compounds.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "9383425", "issn": "1074-5521", "isbn": "1074-5521", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1074-5521(95)90273-2"}, "source": "Chemistry & biology", "authors": [{"first_name": "M", "last_name": "Hansen"}, {"first_name": "S", "last_name": "Yun"}, {"first_name": "L", "last_name": "Hurley"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/hedamycin-intercalates-dna-helix-through-carbohydratemediated-recognition-minor-groove-directs-n7alk", "year": 1995, "keywords": ["Alkylation", "Aminoglycosides", "Anthraquinones", "Anthraquinones: chemistry", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Anti-Bacterial Agents: chemistry", "Antibiotics", "Antineoplastic", "Antineoplastic: chemistry", "Biomolecular", "DNA", "DNA: chemistry", "DNA: drug effects", "Guanine", "Guanine: chemistry", "Intercalating Agents", "Intercalating Agents: chemistry", "Models", "Molecular", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance"], "type": "journal", "id": "d1691f8e-138d-3321-a642-92042f8cbe6a"}, {"title": "Fluorescent d(CGCGAATTCGCG): characterization of major groove polarity and study of minor groove interactions through a major groove semantophore conjugate.", "abstract": "The major and minor groove in duplex DNA are sites of specific molecular recognition by DNA-binding agents such as proteins, drugs and metal complexes and have functional significance.

Accordingly this discussion falls into three sections: the first, remaking as industrial category, deals with issues of production, including industry (commerce' and authors (intention); the second, remaking as textual category, considers texts (plots and structures) and taxonomies; and the third, remaking as critical category, deals with issues of reception, including audiences (recognition) and institutions (discourse).", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-60950151365", "issn": "14690314"}, "source": "Film Studies", "authors": [{"first_name": "Constantine", "last_name": "Verevis"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/remaking-film", "year": 2004, "type": "journal", "id": "3969b184-bbf2-3594-bb06-5adac2127ba1"}, {"title": "Film Theory: an introduction", "abstract": "This book is a lively and provoking introduction to film theory.

Despite the film\u2019s achievements at the box office, it was attacked for being, amongst others, historically incorrect and ideologically biased. In the graphic novel Frank Miller tells the tale of the battle at Thermopylae through the eyes of a Spartan warrior who bore the responsibility of spreading their tale so that the Spartans\u2019 sacrifice might compel other Greek city-states to stand together against the Persians.

Both positive and challenging aspects were identified related to individual volunteers, volunteer coaches, agencies and their staff, and the larger community. The findings are discussed in terms of fostering accessibility for persons with complex needs within their communities. Active participation in community can foster protective and constructive effects. This is especially relevant for individuals with complex disability needs. Persons with complex needs can benefit from linkages with their larger community and from opportunities for enhancement of their quality of life (Hutchison & McGill, 1998; Ochocka & Lord, 1998; Pedlar, 1999). In addition to organizational and societal benefits, community involvement including volunteering has shown to have many positive effects for individuals (Pillivan, 2003).

In this article, we explore different phases of curriculum development, implementation, and evaluation of a method for teaching the testicular exam. METHODS: Medical students participated in surveys and focus groups, and male patients participated in focus groups. From the results of the focus groups, we developed a comprehensive testicular exam module that includes (1) a PowerPoint lecture, (2) a video, (3) reading materials, and (4) an artificial male model (\"Zack\"). These materials were then incorporated into family medicine clerkships. Students and faculty have evaluated the project. RESULTS: Initially, students expressed discomfort discussing sexual issues with patients, especially those of the opposite gender, and knew little about testicular cancer. Male patients had limited knowledge of the testicular self-exam and felt that their physical exam training had not been ideal. Faculty and students agreed that a lecture on the testicular exam and practice with Zack were useful in improving their exam skills, while the video and readings were less so. CONCLUSIONS: To address curricular deficits, a self-contained module on the testicular exam has been successfully incorporated into family medicine clerkships at two different medical schools.

The authors begin by briefly describing the results of empirical research that led to the development and use of IPT, and then discuss in detail IPT for depression. The authors describe the objectives of IPT, the 3 stages of this therapy, and the 4 major problems on which it focuses. The authors then describe the results of studies conducted to examine the efficacy of IPT for depression. Following this discussion, the authors examine extensions of IPT to forms of depression other than major depressive disorder in adults, including depressed adolescents and older adults, adults with dysthymia or recurrent depression, and depression seen in primary-care settings. The authors also examine recent extensions of IPT to problems and disorders other than depression, including general dysphoria, bulimia, and substance abuse.

The methodology is new enough that best practices are still being developed by sponsors and Clinical Research Organizations alike. One clear recommendation that is emerging, however, is to assign the ongoing responsibility of managing a trial's risk to a new member of the study team: the Clinical Risk Manager. The creation of this dedicated role ensures that trial risks are assessed and mitigated systematically by an expert with the express responsibility and authority to do so. The following paper explains the need for this position, what should be expected of a Clinical Risk Manager, and how the role can operate effectively within the study team. The purpose of any risk management plan is to actively find and mitigate sources of risk, ideally by eliminating unwanted variability in all stages of a process. In clinical trials, the emphasis is on identifying, reducing, and monitoring risks to patient safety, data integrity, regulatory and protocol compliance, and project scope (both budget and timelines). Risk-Based Monitoring (RBM) is an innovative strategy for managing risk that concentrates attention on those areas that are critical to the reliability of the study results. By properly assessing risk and applying the most appropriate monitoring strategy according to risk priorities, threats to patient safety and data integrity can be foreseen and either avoided or mitigated because they are caught early.

The water samples were collected during 1993\u20132002. Data on solvents in ground water and source water were available for the conterminous United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. Data on solvents in drinking water only were available for 12 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States. The occurrence and distribution of four solvents were examined\u2014methlyene chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, tetrachloro- ethene, and trichloroethene. Out of 51 to 55 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in samples, solvents were among the most frequently detected VOCs in all data sets. When data from ground water and source water were confined to 12 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States, the detection frequencies of solvents were similar among all three data sets. Although low concentrations of solvents commonly were detected in ground water, some solvents had higher median quantified concentrations than other VOCs. Relative to other VOCs, solvents were ranked high in all data sets in terms of the frequency of concentrations higher than U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Maximum Contaminant Levels. Mixtures were a common mode of occurrence of solvents. The probability of occurrence of solvents was most strongly related to the dissolved-oxygen content in ground water, with solvents having a higher probability of occurrence in conditions of relatively high dissolved oxygen compared to conditions of relatively low dissolved oxygen. The probability of occurrence of solvents in ground water also was strongly associated with urban land use and population density and with variables that represented the transport of solvents through the soil zone to ground water. It is important for ground-water resource managers to understand the contamination potential posed by solvents, especially in resources that are critical as drinking-water supplies. Low-level analytical methods are most useful for determining the complete environmental distribution of solvents in ground water. To protect ground-water resources, it is important for ground-water managers to (1) delineate the redox conditions of ground water in the aquifer in order to predict the potential fate of solvents, (2) determine and control the sources, or potential sources, of solvents to ground water, and (3) establish the susceptibility of aquifers by fully ascertaining the hydraulic properties of the saturated and vadose zones.", "authors": [{"first_name": "J.", "last_name": "Moran, Michael"}], "source": "Director", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/occurrence-implications-selected-chlorinated-solvents-ground-water-source-water-united-states-drinki", "year": 2005, "type": "report", "id": "21dc7abf-81bd-35ba-aba3-4e6d96d976d1"}, {"title": "Urban Land Use , Transport and Environment Models", "abstract": "This paper gives an overview of the ILUMASS project (20022006) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Science and Education.

Vaughan and Niko Henrichon's Pride of Baghdad (2006).2 Off the cuff , I think of: the dyspeptic Asian American Ben Tanaka in Adrian Tomine's Shortcomings (2007); the bipolar Latino Omar Guerrero in Wilfred Santiago's In My Darkest Hour (2004); the angsty Latino suburbanite teen Miguel in Gilbert Hernandez's Sloth (2006); former Gotham City police detective and lesbian Latina Renee Montoya as love interest of Kate Kane (Batwoman) in Geoff Johns and Grant Morrison's maxi-series 52 (issues 1-52, 2006-2007); the Japanese \u00e9migr\u00e9 superhero Sunfire, out of the closet as a lesbian in Judd Winick's Exiles (issue 11, 2001); and Asian American Dupli-Kate, her brother Multi-Paul, and well-heeled black Black Samson in Robert Kirkman's Invincible (issues 2 and 6, 2003). With author-artists at the helm like Los Bros. Hernandez, Santiago, Kirkman, and Winick, to name a few, we see a multiplicity of shades, colors, and sexual orientations expressed in comic book storyworlds.3 Today, for instance when Winick receives fan mail critical of superheroes like Sunfi re or the introduction of Green Lantern's assistant Terry Berg as queer (Green Lantern, vol. 3, issue 137, 2001), he has to ask, \"Which social agenda are you complaining about? Is it the gay people? or the black people or the Asian people? Aft er a while, it doesn't look like a social agenda. Th is is the world we live in\" (Gustines, \"Straight (and Not) Out of the Comics,\" 25). Of course, the world we live in off ers an infinite array of possible experiences and identities for a given author-artist to aesthetically reframe and transform into comic book storyworlds. And this is exactly what author-artists do. They take from the real world and fictional worlds: author-artists of color talk about real, biographical experiences living at the margins of a xenophobic society informing their comics as much as they talk of the influence of fiction, film, and art. In the creation of Rocketo (2006), for instance, Latino Frank Espinosa's fictional world is as much an allegory of the Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9 experience as it is an engagement and radical revision of Homer's Odyssey. (See Aldama's Your Brain on Latino Comics.) Th is isn't too surprising, given that author-artists of color have the capacity to imagine and feel outside of themselves. While categories used by academics and the media like Latino, Asian American, or African American, and so on, might be useful at fi rst to make these author-artists' work visible, at the end of the day, they want not only to have their work judged by the standard of the great comic book author-artists, but also not to have their talent and imagination squeezed into only one identity-politics box. As Espinosa declares, \"If all we do is just talk about one experience in our lives, we will remain trapped\" (Your Brain on Latino Comics, 165). Th ese categories ultimately force the massive creative range of author-artists of color, as Gilbert Hernandez tells Derek Parker Royal in an interview, \"back into a kind of ghetto\" (\"Palomar and Beyond,\" 227). Why shouldn't Latinos or Asian Americans or African Americans or Native Americans be writing, as Espinosa asks, \"the new Lord of the Rings, the new Star Wars, the new Harry Potter?\" (Your Brain on Latino Comics, 165). There are many other author-artists of color who share this sentiment and act upon it. For instance, while Roberta Gregory has created a biographical comic book vignette \"California Girl\" (collected in Roadstrips: A Graphic Journey across America) that touches on experiences growing up Mexican and American in the 1950s Mexicans could only swim on certain days at her public pool her eponymous protagonist \"Bitchy Bitch\" of her trademark comic book has nothing to do with this experience; in fact, she's about as white, racist, and bigoted as they get. And we can say the same of n tive Hawaiian R. Kikuo Johnson's non-ethnic-identifi able protagonist in Night Fisher (2005). In both we see author-artists of color place a large distance between their own biographical experience and the characters and storyworld they create. Any and all comic book author-artists should be free to create any type of storyworld populated by any type of character. There has been a tradition, how-ever, of gatekeeping race-and ethnic-identified experiences and characters. This said, steps have been made toward widening the scope of comic book representations. In the United States, in the wake of civil rights activism, we see a first big growth spurt in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when characters of color began to see the light of day. Behemoths like DC and Marvel, as well as the little guys publishing \"underground comix,\" or others, were off ering more than the typical chiseled white-guy comic book fare. I will leave it to Leonard Rifas in his essay \"Race and Comix\" in this collection to provide the context and specific detail for this shift in the underground comix world. As far as DC and Marvel go, we do see the making of a handful of African American, Latino, Asian American, and Native American superheroes. Several highlights from the late 1960s and the 1970s include: Stan Lee and Gene Colan's inventing in 1969 of the Harlem street thug Sam \"Snap\" Wilson as the Falcon (Captain America, vol. 1, issue 117). In 1972, Archie Goodwin and John Romita Sr. brought to life the Shaft-blaxploitation-styled superhero Carl Lucas in the series Luke Cage, Hero for Hire. A year later Marvel featured the African American day-walker vampire Blade as a supporting character in Tomb of Dracula (issue 10); this was followed by Blade holding his own in a fifty-sixpage solo story in Marvel Preview (issue 3). (See Elizabeth Nixon's \"'It ain't John Shaft ': Marvel Gets Multicultural in The Tomb of Dracula\" in this volume.) In 1977, comic book readers came across one of the arguably more complex superheroes of the day: using his athletic prowess to get out of the ghetto, Jefferson Pierce is a high-school teacher by day and the bioelectric-charged Black Lightning by night (Black Lightning, vol. 1, issue 1). The 1980s and 1990s saw other notable superheroes of color arrive on the scene, including: Steve Englehart and Joe Staton's creating of a team of immortals called the Chosen, as part of their series Millennium, who are recruited to \"advance the human race\" (issues 1, p.4, 1988). The team includes, among others, an Australian aboriginal woman, Bett y Clawman; a Maoist from mainland China, Xiang Po; an Inuit, Tom Kalmaku; an Afro-Caribbean Brit, Celia Windward; and Gregorio de la Vega, born and raised Peruvian. In 1997 Christopher Priest (writer) and ChrisCross (artist) created the African American pro-basketball player Coltrane \"Trane\" Walker as the superhero Xer\u00f8, who performs a sort of white minstrelsy (blond-haired wig and whiteface mask) to sleuth out and foil espionage operations that threaten the nation. While in this period we see African-American-identified superheroes picking up the relative lion's share of representation, there were several notable Asians, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, including the Japanese-identified Sunfire (X-Men, vol. 1, issue 64, 1970). There has been a tradition of Native Americans appearing as sidekicks, the easily disposable, and the preternaturally ecological in comics. In mainstream comics, we had, for example, superheroes like Cheyenne William Talltrees, who dons the ceremonial garb of Red Wolf appearing in Avengers (vol. 1, issue 80, 1970), the Apache James Proudstar as Warpath (New Mutants, vol. 1, issue 16, 1984), and his elder brother John Proudstar as Thunderbird, with his super senses, strength, speed, and stamina (Giant-Size X-Men, issue 1, 1975). There have also been some notable Latino superheroes. Marvel introduced Bonita Juarez as Firebird in 1981; DC introduced Paco Ramone as Vibe in 1984, as well as Rafael Sandoval as El Diablo in 1989. In 1993 Latino author-artist Ivan Velez Jr. illed out with rich complexity a team of queer and straight Latino superheroes (Dominican, Puerto Rican, Afro-Hispanic, among others) in the Milestone series Blood Syndicate. \u00a9 2010 by University of Texas Press.

This exercise in extrapolation is designed to illuminate one of the more knotty issues in sf historiography: how to grasp the reality of change within a system that seems, in so many ways, quite comfortably teleological. On the one hand, not only was the advent of the New Wave envisioned as a pivotal rupture with the genre\u2019s past by its early advocates, but it was actually experienced as such by many readers during the late 1960s and early 1970s; moreover, it coincided with an epochal reordering of sf\u2019s matrix of production and distribution, as the pulp era\u2014and, to a significant extent, the hegemony of the magazines themselves\u2014gave way to an exploding book market. On the other hand, more traditional forms of sf continued to be published, and the genre had absorbed and to a large extent neutralized the New Wave agenda by the end ...", "identifiers": {"issn": "00917729"}, "source": "Science Fiction Studies", "authors": [{"first_name": "Source", "last_name": "Science"}, {"first_name": "Fiction", "last_name": "Studies"}, {"first_name": "No", "last_name": "March"}, {"first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Latham"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/2011-science-fiction-studies-symposium-singularity-sf-literature-theory", "year": 2012, "type": "journal", "id": "86be8d57-6999-30b2-bff4-cc196c9b4fda"}, {"title": "Sources and Their Use", "abstract": "Andrew Solomon uses many different types of soures on his website.

The second period overlaps the first, but a new perspective becomes dominant in the 1970s; the emphasis is on positive qualities of Aboriginal culture and on common ground between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. After the 1970s, increased awareness of political injustice and fears of impinging on Aboriginal experience and intellectual property cause most European-Australians to avoid the topic altogether. In the same period, however, non-white writers begin to explore the possibilities of using science-fictional discourse to redefine their own history, identity, and traditions.

Main outcome measures. Demographic profiles, referring specialty, pain diagnosis, pain sites, duration and severity of pain, treatment modality, litigation, compensation, and social welfare status. Data were collected using a standardised questionnaire. Results. Two hundred and forty-eight patients were interviewed. Most patients (70%) were middle-aged, with 21% over 60 years. Seventy-nine percent of patients were referred to the clinics either from orthopaedic surgeons (64.1%), general and other surgeons (14.9%), or general practitioners (3.6%). The median (range) duration of pain was 2.3 (0.08-26.7) years. The most common pain diagnoses were musculoskeletal back pain (46.4%) and neuropathic pain (27.8%). A total of 11.3% of the patients had two pain diagnoses, while 40.7% complained of pain in more than one location. Pain in the limbs was the most frequent complaint followed by the head, neck, and back. Approximately 38% of patients had tried four or more treatment modalities. Oral medication was the most common method (86.7%) of pain-relief treatment. More than half of the patients had also tried physiotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine. Approximately 37% of the patients were unemployed, while 31% were receiving social security subsidy. Eighty-six patients had pain associated with a work-related injury, and of these patients, 80% were involved in compensation claims. Conclusions. The profile of patients referred to the pain management clinics was complex. Patients were mainly referred from specialists. The economic implication in this group of patients is likely to be significant as many patients utilised multiple treatment modalities, were unemployed and on social welfare benefits, and were involved in compensation and litigation proceedings.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "15181217", "issn": "1024-2708", "isbn": "1024-2708 (Print)"}, "source": "Hong Kong Medical Journal", "authors": [{"first_name": "P P", "last_name": "Chen"}, {"first_name": "J", "last_name": "Chen"}, {"first_name": "T", "last_name": "Gin"}, {"first_name": "M", "last_name": "Ma"}, {"first_name": "K C", "last_name": "Fung"}, {"first_name": "K H", "last_name": "Woo"}, {"first_name": "P Y", "last_name": "Wong"}, {"first_name": "Chen", "last_name": "P.P."}, {"first_name": "Chen", "last_name": "J."}, {"first_name": "Gin", "last_name": "T."}, {"first_name": "Ma", "last_name": "M."}, {"first_name": "Fung", "last_name": "K.C."}, {"first_name": "Woo", "last_name": "K.H."}, {"first_name": "Wong", "last_name": "P.Y."}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/outpatient-chronic-pain-service-hong-kong-prospective-study", "year": 2004, "keywords": ["Chinese medicine", "Chronic Disease", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Employment", "Female", "Health Care Surveys", "Hong Kong", "Hospital", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Musculoskeletal Diseases", "Occupational Diseases", "Outpatient Clinics", "Pain", "Pain Management", "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases", "Prospective Studies", "Referral and Consultation", "Social Security", "Workers' Compensation", "adult", "article", "backache", "chronic pain", "clinical feature", "complications", "etiology", "female", "general practitioner", "headache", "human", "major clinical study", "male", "neck pain", "neuropathy", "occupational accident", "orthopedics", "outpatient", "patient referral", "physiotherapy", "prospective study", "public hospital", "questionnaire", "statistics & numerical data", "therapy"], "type": "journal", "id": "7c3a9578-6636-36f9-b650-b75fb906fc21"}, {"title": "Aortic dissection in an accident and emergency department in Hong Kong", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical characteristics of aortic dissection in Hong Kong with the International Registry of Aortic Dissection, and to evaluate the sensitivity of the Accident and Emergency Department in diagnosing aortic dissection and its role in aortic dissection management.

PATIENTS: Newly diagnosed aortic dissection patients attending the Accident and Emergency Department from 2002 to 2005 inclusive. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Correct diagnosis in Accident and Emergency Department, tertiary unit transfer, and in-patient mortality. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were found to have aortic dissection, with an estimated annual incidence of 2.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. The sensitivity of Accident and Emergency Department in diagnosing aortic dissection was 54%; 11% of the patients were diagnosed at postmortem examination.

Patients: All children younger than the age of 18 years with foreign body aspiration admitted to the study hospital from 1 January 1993 to 31 May 2006. Results: Sixteen (59%) of the patients were categorised into the early-diagnosis group (correctly diagnosed foreign body aspiration <7 days of symptom onset) and 11 (41%) into the late-diagnosis group (correctly diagnosed \u22657 days after symptom onset). The common clinical manifestations of foreign body aspiration were persistent cough (100%) and history of choking (74%). Most children (82%) in the late-diagnosis group and 25% in early-diagnosis group (P=0.004) were misdiagnosed as respiratory infections and asthma. Intrabronchial granulation was more common in the late-diagnosis group (13% vs 55%, P=0.033). Peanuts and watermelon seeds accounted for 85% of the aspirations; 63% of the foreign body aspirations occurred around the Chinese New Year festival.

FOXM1 is a key regulator of both G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle [2][3][4][5][6][7] and mitotic spindle integrity[8]. Besides its involvement in cell cycle transitions, it also plays an important role in angiogenesis[9], metastasis[10], apoptosis[11][12][7], DNA damage repair[13] and tissue regeneration[14]. The human FOXM1 gene consists of 10 exons of which two are alternatively spliced. These splice events give rise to three different splice variants named FOXM1a, -b and -c[15][16][17]. FOXM1b and FOXM1c act as transactivators and can activate their target genes by two different mechanisms. They both activate through binding to conventional FOXM1 binding sites 5\u2019-A(C/T)AAA(C/T)AA-3\u2019[18] while FOXM1c can additionally activate genes by binding to the TATA-boxes[19][20][21]. The splice variant FOXM1a is transcriptionally inactive due to disruption of the transactivation domain and might also cause dominant-negative effects as it has retained a functional DNA binding domain[17]. FOXM1 is ubiquitously expressed in proliferating cells[22] and has a positive effect on cell growth by promoting G1/S as well as G2/M-transition during the cell cycle[2][3][4][5][6][7]. Its expression levels are shown to correlate with the proliferative state of a cell and are antagonistically regulated by proliferation and anti-proliferation signals. In quiescent or terminally differentiated cells FOXM1 levels are barely detectable[15]. FOXM1 deficient cells show polyploidy, aneuploidy, defects in cytokinesis, chromosome missegregation as well as an increase in the number of DNA breaks. These findings suggest an important role of FOXM1 in the maintenance of genome stability [8][23] and DNA damage repair[13]. Additionally, cells exposed to DNA damaging radiation show an increase in FOXM1 protein levels indicating its involvement in DNA repair processes[13]. Post-translational modifications play an important role in the regulation of FOXM1. The phosphorylation condition of FOXM1 determines its cellular localisation and activation state. Phosphorylation by Raf-MEK-ERK causes FOXM1 to translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus during late S-phase after which further phosphorylation steps take place[24][25]. Hyperphosphorylation during G2-M phase correlates with increased transcriptional activity of FOXM1 which suggests phosphorylation as an important regulation step in the activation of the protein. Conserved putative phosphorylation sites indicate the involvement of various Cyclin-Cdk complexes as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade[26][24][27]. Furthermore, phosphorylation by checkpoint kinase 2 in response to DNA damage was shown to increase FOXM1 stability and its transcriptional activity[13]. The important roles of FOXM1 during cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair have given this transcription factor a crucial role within the development and progression of many cancers, including colorectal [28], lung [4], prostate [29], liver [30] and breast cancer [31]. A microarray study also shows that FOXM1 expression is elevated in carcinomas of the prostate, lung, ovary, colon, pancreas, stomach, bladder, liver, kidney and breast [32]. In most human tumours FOXM1 levels are significantly higher[33] while the expression level increases with tumour grade and is inversely correlated with patient survival[34].", "year": 2009, "source": "Transcription factor encyclopedia", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/foxm1", "authors": [{"first_name": "Eric W.-F.", "last_name": "Schwenen, Helma D.

The high mobility group (HMG) box of the mammalian testis-determining factor SRY encodes for a DNA-binding domain which is conserved in all SOX proteins throughout the animal kingdom and binds to specific sequences in the minor groove of DNA2. SOX transcription factors interact with other co-factors to form nucleoprotein complexes and co-operative binding of these complexes results in sharp bending of the target DNA which is thought to be involved in chromatin remodelling and establishment of broad transcriptional programs3,4. Furthermore, SOX proteins have been implicated in pre-mRNA splicing5. The HMG domain of SOX9 contains nuclear import and export sequences enabling functionally important shuttling of SOX9 protein between cytoplasm and nucleus6,7. SOX9 belongs to the SoxE subgroup of SOX proteins including SOX8 and SOX10 which are structurally related by the presence of additional, conserved protein domains: an N-terminal dimerization domain, and two separate transactivation (TA) domains, one in the central position and one at the C terminus2. Sox9 is expressed in multiple tissues during mouse development8,9 and adulthood and its spatio- temporal expression pattern is regulated by a >2 Mb genomic region containing several evolutionary conserved, tissue-specific control elements10. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the human SOX9 gene or chromosomal aberrations with breakpoints located hundreds of kilobases away from the SOX9 coding region cause the semilethal skeletal malformation syndrome campomelic dysplasia (CD) that is generally associated with male-to-female sex reversal and other variable organ defects11,12. Functional studies in the mouse have identified essential roles for Sox9 during successive stages of cartilage formation [e. formation of mesenchymal cell condensations and chondrocyte differentiation13,14] and during sex determination [e. testis cord formation and Sertoli cell differentiation15,16] involving the regulation of diverse cellular processes such as condensation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Furthermore, several target genes of Sox9 including the direct targets collagen type II alpha 1 (Col2a1)17 and anti-Mullerian hormone (Amh)18 have been characterized and Sox9-regulated gene interaction networks have been defined19,20. Sox9 has also been shown to control several important aspects during development and/or differentiation of glial cells21, hair22, heart23,24, intestinal epithelium25, melanocytes26, neural crest cells27, notochord28, otic placode29, pancreas30, prostate31, pyloric sphincter32 and retina33.

It was originally discovered in association with 4-7% of cases of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias harbouring a t(10;14)(q24;q11) cytogenetic abnormality. Studies by three independent groups discovered the presence of the TLX1 gene on chromosome 10q24 juxtaposed with the T cell receptor (TCR) delta regulatory elements on chromosome 10, resulting in aberrant over-expression of the full and intact TLX1 gene1,2,3. Juxtaposition with the TCR alpha locus was also seen2. Elevated TLX1 expression in leukemic blasts in also detected in the absence of a translocation in ~50% (37/76) of pediatric T-ALL cases4, as well as rare cases of B-ALL5. Clinically, TLX1+ T-ALLs are associated with a genetic signature associated with maturation arrest at an early cortical thymocyte stage of T cell development 6, and respond well to conventional chemotherapy7. The TLX1 gene encodes a 342-amino acid protein with a N-terminal glycine- and proline-rich domain, followed by a putative DNA-binding homeodomain. TLX1 is the founding member of the TLX family of homeobox genes (which also includes TLX2 and TLX3), which is distinguished by a threonine in helix-3 of the homeodomain rather than the more common isoleucine or valine found in other HOX proteins8. Like most homeobox genes, the canonical role of TLX1 appears to be in spleen development. Tlx1-knockout mice are asplenic9 and exhibit a mildly delayed cytotoxic response to vaccinia virus infection10, but are otherwise developmentally normal. Chimeric studies revealed a critical role for TLX1 in directing mesodermal precursors down a splenic cell fate during embryogenesis11. The molecular role of TLX1 in mediating cellular transformation, however, remains unclear and is the subject of active investigation. To date, it is recognized that there are both transcription dependent and independent mechanisms of TLX1-induced oncogenesis which may not be mutually exclusive. The transcriptiondependent mechanisms implicate target genes transactivated by TLX1:PBX1 heterodimers as being important for eliciting cellular transformation12. However, to date, the actual genes targeted by TLX1 in association with leukemogenesis remain unclear. Several studies have also indicated that TLX1 may promote oncogenesis through roles independent of direct transcriptional activation of target genes. Rather, TLX1 has been proposed to exert its leukemogenic effects through discruption of multiple cell cycle processes, mediated largely through direct protein-protein interaction with key players of the cell cycle apparatus at multiple cell cycle checkpoints. In particular, it has been shown to bind directly with the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, which has been implicated in aberrant G1/S, G2/M and spindle checkpoint transition13,14.", "identifiers": {"issn": "1476-4598"}, "year": 2010, "source": "Transcription Factor Encyclopedia", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/tlx1-mus-musculus-tcell-leukemia-homeobox-1", "authors": [{"first_name": "Margaret R.", "last_name": "Hough"}, {"first_name": "Edwin", "last_name": "Chen"}], "keywords": ["HOX11", "T-ALL", "TLX1"], "id": "a944183e-a71c-31ef-bde0-bfbaac7d46a2"}, {"title": "Modular recognition of 5-base-pair DNA sequence motifs by human heat shock transcription factor.", "abstract": "We investigated the recognition of the conserved 5-bp repeated motif NGAAN, which occurs in heat shock gene promoters of Drosophila melanogaster and other eukaryotic organisms, by human heat shock transcription factor (HSF).

In the current study we have analyzed separately the functions of repeats 2 and 3 by altering their sequences, inserting them into the -60 position of the thymidine kinase promoter, and introducing the hybrid promoters into hamster cells by transfection. These studies show that repeat 3 is a constitutive positive transcriptional element that acts in the absence or presence of sterols. Repeat 2 confers strong repression upon repeat 3 when sterols are present. In vitro DNase footprinting and gel retardation assays show that repeat 3, but not repeat 2, binds purified Sp1, a positive transcription factor.

Any amendments to the law probably seemed quite insignificant at the time they were made, but the reality of day to day life gradually began to transform the way society viewed women and the way they viewed themselves. By the end of the First Century women had achieved a level of freedom they would not see again in Western Society until the last half of the Twentieth Century. Life was hard in the Ancient World and death, disease and hunger lurked around every corner.

At no time in Rome's history were women allowed to hold public office or work in the government. In the early days of the Republic women were not even allowed to make suggestions, but by the beginning of the Empire many men were seeking and even following the advice of their wives. It was all right to do so, provided the advice was given in private and the husband did not make a big deal of it.

Previous works of garbage collections in a causal message logging protocol try to solve the garbage collection of message determinant log and force additional checkpoints[5,6,7]. In order to avoid the sympathetic rollback, we classify the fault tolerance information into message determinants logs and message contents logs. Then we propose new definitions for garbage collections conditions for message determinant logs and message content logs and present a garbage collection algorithm. To represent determinants of messages, a data structure called MAG (Modified Antecedence Graph) is proposed. MAG is an extension of Antecedence Graph of Manetho system [7] and it is used for garbage collections conditions of message determinant logs and message content logs. Unlike Manetho system that needs additional messages for garbage collection of message content logs, our algorithm does not need additional messages. The proposed garbage collection algorithm makes 'the lazy garbage collection effect' because it relies on the piggybacked checkpoint information in send/receive message.

This article draws on references to Jerusalem from nearly twenty different sources, dating from the third century BCE to the third century CE, which are included in the late Professor Menahem Stern's comprehensive anthology, Greek and Latin Authors on Jews and Judaism. An examination of these texts indicates the unanimous agreement that Jerusalem was Jewish by virtue of the fact that its inhabitants were Jews, it was founded by Jews and the Temple, located in Jerusalem, was the center of the Jewish religion. In these sources, Jerusalem appears in several contexts: foundation narratives, descriptions of and links to the Temple, historical events, usually relating to invasions and captures of the city, physical descriptions, and the derogatory use of the term \"Solyma\" by Roman writers after its destruction by Titus in 70 CE. It is noteworthy that despite the negative views of Jews and Judaism expressed by authors such as Manetho, Apion, Tacitus and Juvenal, the Jewish identity of Jerusalem is always clear and never a subject of dispute. These ancient texts, therefore, disprove recent attempts by Muslims and others to deny the historic connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem and the location of the Temple in Jerusalem through fabrications and lies.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-77950726483", "issn": "0792335X"}, "source": "Jewish Political Studies Review", "authors": [{"first_name": "Rivkah", "last_name": "Fishman-Duker"}, {"first_name": "Rivkah", "last_name": "Duker-Fishman"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/perspectives-jerusalem-capital-jews-jewish-identity-jerusalem-greek-roman-sources", "year": 2008, "type": "journal", "id": "c2e6adba-1770-3ff2-91d5-c1560422d605"}, {"title": "Literary forgeries", "abstract": "Chapter I.

Primary credit for holding the line against crime belongs to the New York City Police Department. The department faced the greatest volume of crime ever, with the smallest complement of personnel in over 25 years. In courts and corrections, 1981 witnessed little progress and major failures. For example, the State corrections commissioner was caught between a Federal court order to accept more prisoners in facilities already at 112-percent capacity and a State court directive forbidding further overcrowding. The period from May through September 1981 witnessed a decline in total Index crimes; 311,1973 crimes were recorded in 1981 compared with 321,105 for 1980. This decline is attributable to police department efforts targeting robbery and the career criminal. Problem areas which remain in the enforcement area include police personnel reduction, command structure, and development of effective control strategies for subway crime. Leading authorities have urged more certainty in sentencing for years, but by 1981 this consistency had not been achieved. Reforms are also recommended in the areas of jury selection, bail, and the juvenile court.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts held that legislation prohibiting the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) from covering the cost of aborting an anencephalic fetus violated the due process clause and was unconstitutional because it served no rational, legitimate state interest. Britell decided to have an abortion when she learned that her fetus suffered from anencephaly, a fatal neural tube defect. CHAMPUS, her insurer, refused to cover the cost because it only funded abortions when the life of the mother would be endangered by carrying the fetus to term. The court held that CHAMPUS's regulations did not further the legitimate state interest in \"potential life.\" The court noted that anencephaly is considered inconsistent with \"potential life\" after birth and a full term pregnancy, and that a physician may withhold treatment of an anencephalic newborn. The court saw no reason why anencephaly would be consistent with \"potential life\" before birth and cited other regulations and commission reports supporting the position. The court also reasoned that funding Britell's abortion would result in a net cost savings to all parties involved. Based on this evidence, the court found no compelling rationale for forcing women to carry an anencephalic fetus destined to certain death and therefore granted Britell's motion for summary judgment.", "authors": [{"first_name": "District of Massachusetts", "last_name": "United States.

This study characterizes the environmental exposures resulting from destruction of the WTC and assesses their effects on health. Methods include ambient air sampling; analyses of outdoor and indoor settled dust; high-altitude imaging and modeling of the atmospheric plume; inhalation studies of WTC dust in mice; and clinical examinations, community surveys, and prospective epidemiologic studies of exposed populations. WTC dust was found to consist predominantly (95%) of coarse particles and contained pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated furans and dioxins. Airborne particulate levels were highest immediately after the attack and declined thereafter. Particulate levels decreased sharply with distance from the WTC. Dust pH was highly alkaline (pH 9.0-11.0). Mice exposed to WTC dust showed only moderate pulmonary inflammation but marked bronchial hyperreactivity. Evaluation of 10,116 firefighters showed exposure-related increases in cough and bronchial hyperreactivity. Evaluation of 183 cleanup workers showed new-onset cough (33%), wheeze (18%), and phlegm production (24%). Increased frequency of new-onset cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath were also observed in community residents. Follow-up of 182 pregnant women who were either inside or near the WTC on 11 September showed a 2-fold increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. In summary, environmental exposures after the WTC disaster were associated with significant adverse effects on health. The high alkalinity of WTC dust produced bronchial hyperreactivity, persistent cough, and increased risk of asthma. Plausible causes of the observed increase in SGA infants include maternal exposures to PAH and particulates. Future risk of mesothelioma may be increased, particularly among workers and volunteers exposed occupationally to asbestos. Continuing follow-up of all exposed populations is required to document the long-term consequences of the disaster.

In the current study we have analyzed separately the functions of repeats 2 and 3 by altering their sequences, inserting them into the -60 position of the thymidine kinase promoter, and introducing the hybrid promoters into hamster cells by transfection. These studies show that repeat 3 is a constitutive positive transcriptional element that acts in the absence or presence of sterols.

There are a number of psychological and sociological factors, as well as questions of prior academic background in and support for the home language, that influence the linguistic choices that students make regarding academic communication (Levine, 2011). By providing a bilingual constructed response assessment and tracking the language(s) in which students both read the questions and wrote their responses (combined with basic demographic information), we attempted to create a more useful functional measure of student ability in using home and school languages for academic purposes (Shaw, Bunch, & Geaney, 2010). Such a resource could be used to support teachers in exploring the potential benefits of building on first-language resources to support science learning through writing (Rosebery & Warren, 2008). We conceptualize science learning as mastering a combination of practices, core conceptual ideas, and communication skills that are developed across a broad range of life-wide learning contexts (National Research Council, 2011, 2009). From this perspective, a primary goal of science learning is to gain competence in applying critical thinking processes used for problem solving during science tasks (Kuhn, 2005). For Kuhn, these critical thinking processes include generating and testing hypotheses, using cause-and -effect reasoning, learning to control variables, and arguing from evidence. We extend Kuhn's ideas by focusing on science tasks that prompt students' science talk, writing, and action in ways that support development of critical communication practices as well as critical thinking practices. Duschl and Grandy (2008) have argued that worthwhile science learning tasks make student thinking visible to help teachers improve students' scientific thinking. Writing about science investigations can serve this purpose (Gunel, Hand, & Prain, 2007). We developed a bilingual constructed response assessment that asks students to write about science investigations (Buxton et al., 2013) as part of our Language-Rich Inquiry Science with English Language Learners (LISELL) Project to support a more robust measure of students' scientific thinking as expressed through writing. There is a limited but growing body of research on the value of teachers attending to the science writing of emergent bilingual learners as a way to both understand and improve these students' science learning experiences. For example, Huerta, Lara-Alecio, Tong, and Irby (2014) developed and tested a science notebook rubric to measure both the conceptual understanding and the academic language skills expressed in upper elementary grade second language learners' writing. Similarly, Furtak and Ruiz-Primo (2008) compared middle school students' written responses with their oral discussions about the same formative assessment prompts and found that the written responses elicited a greater range of students' science conceptions. Further, one of us was involved in an earlier study that used emergent Double Helix, Vol 2 (2014) 2 bilingual learners' writing to measure their developing English proficiency and ability to explain science concepts by exploring the relationship between the form (i.e., conventions, organization, and style/voice) and content (i.e., specific knowledge and understanding of science) of their expository science writing (Lee, Penfield, & Buxton, 2011). Thus, while there is growing evidence on the value of studying bilingual learners' writing for supporting their science learning, there is less evidence about how best to support these students' science writing on either formative or summative assessments as part of that process. The research to date on language accommodations for bilingual learners on assessments is both limited and ambiguous, with a wide range of potential accommodation strategies having been proposed to support emergent bilingual learners. For example, during the 2005 and 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science assessments in the United States, English learners were allowed the use of bilingual dictionaries, bilingual texts, subject-specific glossaries, English language dictionaries, extra time to complete assessments, having test items read aloud, permission to ask clarifying questions, and permission to dictate oral responses to a scribe (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2011). All of these accommodations were meant to help English learners make sense of the language of the assessment as written. None of the accommodations, however, modified the language of the assessment itself, such as through translation of test items, or simplification of language to avoid unnecessarily complex grammatical constructions, polysemic terms, or idiomatic expressions. In a meta-analysis of testing accommodations, Kieffer, Lesaux, Rivera, and Francis (2009) examined the effectiveness and the validity of specific testing accommodations for improving the performance of bilingual learners on large-scale assessments in mathematics and science. Effectiveness was defined in terms of whether bilingual learners who received an accommodation outperformed bilingual learners who did not receive the accommodation. Validity was defined in terms of whether an accommodation altered the overall construct validity of a test, measured by whether monolingual learners who received an accommodation outperformed monolingual learners who did not receive the accommodation. The researchers analyzed data from 11 studies on the effects of accommodations for bilingual learners on NAEP, Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and various state assessments in the United States in mathematics and science at fourth and eighth grades. The studies considered accommodations including extra time, dual language questions, a Spanish version of the assessment, use of a bilingual dictionary, use of an English dictionary, and simplified English language versions of test questions. The results indicated that the only accommodation that consistently improved bilingual learners' performance was providing students with an English language dictionary. This finding raises intriguing questions about why various first language supports and other linguistic accommodations did not yield improved test performance. In a contrasting finding, Siegel (2007) studied accommodations for bilingual learners on teacher-developed assessments in two seventh-grade life science classes that used National Science Foundation supported science curriculum materials. Participating students were bilingual learners who had some proficiency in reading and writing in English, as well as native English speakers in the same classes. Siegel studied 11 kinds of assessment modifications made to support linguistic (e.g., reducing the number of words), cognitive (e.g., adding a graphic organizer), and visual (e.g., including a picture) clarifications to assessment items. Results indicated that both native English speakers and emergent bilingual learners scored significantly higher on the modified classroom assessments. Thus, these modifications, unlike the accommodations studied in Keiffer et al's analysis of standardized tests, did improve bilingual learners' performance but", "authors": [{"first_name": "Cory", "last_name": "Buxton"}, {"first_name": "Martha", "last_name": "Allexsaht-Snider"}, {"first_name": "Rouhollah", "last_name": "Aghasaleh"}, {"first_name": "Shakhnoza", "last_name": "Kayumova"}, {"first_name": "Seo-Hyun", "last_name": "Kim"}, {"first_name": "Youn-Jeng", "last_name": "Choi"}, {"first_name": "Allan", "last_name": "Cohen"}], "source": "Double Helix", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/potential-benefits-bilingual-constructed-response-science-assessments-understanding-bilingual-learne", "year": 2014, "type": "journal", "id": "fedb5ba3-b6f6-3a26-943e-20d9c8157e31"}, {"title": "DNA-like double helix formed by peptide nucleic acid.", "abstract": "Although the importance of the nucleobases in the DNA double helix is well understood, the evolutionary significance of the deoxyribose phosphate backbone and the contribution of this chemical entity to the overall helical structure and stability of the double helix is not so clear.

Using circular dichroism spectroscopy we show here that two complementary PNA strands can hybridize to one another to form a helical duplex.

Located in the suburban borough of Forest Hills, the laboratory was set up to provide scientific knowledge for the older materials testing and product development laboratories at the factory. Unlike its industrial counterparts, however, the Forest Hills laboratory was dominated by a strong engineering research tradition that disrupted efforts undertaken in the 1920s and again in the 1930s to build and sustain a diversified fundamental research program. Whereas Eastman Kodak, DuPont, AT&T, and General Electric had successfully integrated fundamental research into their corporate laboratories, the Forest Hills laboratory remained the site of recurring tensions between two cultures of innovation - one based on fundamental science, the other on engineering research. Although such tensions often resulted in competing research strategies, managerial conflicts, and mismatched corporate priorities, the long-standing culture of engineering research contributed far more to Westinghouse's strategic growth than even the most advanced fundamental research. More generally, the interactions between the cultures of engineering and science that characterize the early history of industrial research at Westinghouse highlight the evolving and sometimes conflicting patterns of technological innovation and organizational change in American industry before World War II.

Girls have learned to express themselves physically in organized sports--thirty years ago, the number of boys playing organized sports was over ten times greater than the number of girls; now the ratio is almost at one to one. In a number of other ways too, the cultural foot binding that has kept girls from embracing their own physical power has been removed, which is largely to be celebrated. But nothing happens in isolation, and there's rarely such a momentous societal shift with absolutely no downside. One problem is that girls aren't being trained to handle their own physical aggression the way boys are: our culture's methods of child-rearing include all sorts of mechanisms for socializing boys to express their violence in socially acceptable ways, but with girls we lag very far behind. At the same time, the culture has become more toxic for boys and girls alike, and girls' sexuality is linked with violence in new and disturbing ways. Ultimately this brilliant, far-reaching examination of physical aggression and the \"new\" American girl shows us there is much we can do differently.

When market forces rather than science drive mental health care, children are placed in grave danger. Since 2001, the prescription rate has doubled for toddlers and preschoolers and quadrupled for children in low-income households. Antipsychotics are being used to treat an ever-expanding roster of pediatric conditions such as ADHD, depression, insomnia, and \"anger management,\" though no sound research exists to support these applications. Even where FDA approval has been granted-to treat pediatric bipolar disorder, for example-the research, which was funded by the pharmaceutical industry, is of questionable validity. Drugging our children documents the impact of antipsychotics on children's health, spotlights the historical and cultural factors that have contributed to this dangerous trend, and exposes the role of the pharmaceutical industry in creating a child market for antipsychotics. The ethical and legal dimensions of the surge in antipsychotic prescriptions for children are also examined. The book explores the rights and responsibilities of non-MD mental health practitioners such as psychologists to intervene if they believe that a child in their care is being harmed by antipsychotics. Additionally, the work considers what legal recourse parents have if their child has been harmed by psychiatric medication-and the risks involved if they refuse to medicate their child. Drugging our children offers evidence-based interventions for children with emotional and behavioral challenges without recourse to antipsychotics, and it addresses the power of family and communities to foster and protect children's psychological development before problems arise or become entrenched.

SdB stars are usually identified with models of core helium burning Extreme Horizontal-Branch (EHB) stars of half a solar mass. A spectral analysis of the hydrogen and helium lines resulted in T_eff = 21 500 +/- 500 K, log g = 5.66 +/- 0.05 placing the star below the EHB. HD 188112 was found to be radial velocity (RV) variable and the RV curve has been measured to be perfectly sinusoidal with a period of 0.606585 days and a semi-amplitude of 188.3 km s-1 indicating that it is a close binary system. From the atmospheric parameters and the Hipparcos parallax we conclude that the sdB star is of low mass (0.24 Msun). The mass of the sdB is too low to sustain core helium burning and it is now evolving into a helium core white dwarf. A lower limit to the mass of its unseen companion of 0.73 Msun is derived from the mass function. Because the companion does not contribute to the spectral energy distribution from the UV to the infrared it cannot be a main sequence star but must be a white dwarf (WD), a neutron star (NS) or a black hole. The system would qualify as pre-supernova Ia candidate (sdB+WD) if its total mass is above the Chandrasekhar limit (1.4 Msun), or as post-supernova (sdB+NS) if the companion mass is above that limit, requiring the inclination angle to be lower than 51deg or 48deg, respectively.

Recent theoretical work concerning this problem is discussed and a plasma mechanism of radio eclipses in the PSR B1957+20 binary system is presented. The companion star is assumed to be a degenerate white dwarf with nearly dipolar magnetosphere filled with relativistic particles of the pulsar wind. It is argued that radio waves are strongly damped in the companion's magnetosphere due to the cyclotron resonance with particles of the electron-positron plasma. The large, stable, continuous and frequency-dependent eclipses should occur as a result of this process, which agrees well with observations. Possible mechanisms of generation of the optical and high-energy emission are also suggested in the framework of the presented model.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-3142594277", "issn": "00046361"}, "source": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "authors": [{"first_name": "D.", "last_name": "Khechinashvili"}, {"first_name": "G.", "last_name": "Melikidze"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/letter-editor-model-binary-pulsar-radio-eclipse-astronomy", "year": 1997, "keywords": ["20 - binaries", "eclipsing", "psr b1957", "pulsars"], "type": "journal", "id": "93c1d002-bef2-3ab1-b40e-b74a9b43ad96"}, {"title": "Astronomy & Astrophysics", "abstract": "About one-quarter of the extrasolar giant planets discovered so far have orbital distances smaller than 0.1AU. These \u201c51Peg b-like\u201d planets can now be directly characterized, as shown by the planet transiting in front the star HD 209458. We review the processes that affect their evolution. We apply our work to the case of HD 209458b, whose radius has been recently measured.We argue that its radius can be reproduced only when the deep atmosphere is assumed to be unrealistically hot. When using more realistic atmospheric temperatures, an energy source appears to be missing in order to explain HD 209458b\u2019s large size. The most likely source of energy available is not in the planet\u2019s spin or orbit, but in the intense radiation received from the parent star.

A greater exchange of angular momentum could affect the stability of the terrestrial planets. Moreover, the planet in the asteroid belt could itself excite terrestrial planet eccentricities. To study these effects, we have simulated several systems consisting of the Solar System planets and a 0.1\u201310 Earth mass (M\u2295) object on the orbit of a main belt asteroid or on an initially circular orbit at Ceres's semimajor axis. An integration with Ceres at 5 M\u2295 remained stable for a billion years. Ceres at 10 M\u2295, however, caused the system to become unstable at \u223c25\u201350 myr. When additional mass was given to both Ceres (bringing it up to 2 M\u2295) and Mars (1 M\u2295), the systems self-destructed in <100 myr. However, if these bodies were grown at an epoch when Mars' eccentricity was small, the resulting system was stable for the entire 500 myr simulated. Analogous results were found when other asteroids were grown to planetary masses.

In a recent paper we have shown that dust can sediment inside the embryos, as argued earlier by Boss (1998) in a slightly different model. Here we study numerically the next stage of this process -- the formation of a solid core. If conditions are conducive to solid core formation, the centre of the gas cloud goes through the following sequence of phases: (i) becomes grain (and metal) rich; (ii) forms a terrestrial mass solid core via a rapid collapse driven by self-gravity of the grains; (iii) starts to accrete a gaseous atmosphere when the solid core reaches mass of a few to 10 Earth masses. This sequence of events may build either terrestrial planet cores or metal rich giant planets inside the larger gas reservoir of the giant planet embryo. In a companion Letter we argue that tidal and irradiation effects from the parent star should disrupt the outer metal poor layers of the embryo, releasing nearly \"ready to use\" planets.

The Grand Tack model invokes a specific migration history of the giant planets to remove most of the mass initially beyond 1 AU and to dynamically excite the asteroid belt. However, one could also invoke a steep density gradient created by inward drift and pile-up of small particles induced by gas-drag, as has been proposed to explain the formation of close-in super Earths. Here we show that the asteroid belt's orbital excitation provides a crucial constraint against this scenario for the Solar System. We performed a series of simulations of terrestrial planet formation and asteroid belt evolution starting from disks of planetesimals and planetary embryos with various radial density gradients and including Jupiter and Saturn on nearly circular and coplanar orbits. Disks with shallow density gradients reproduce the dynamical excitation of the asteroid belt by gravitational self-stirring but form Mars analogs significantly more massive than the real planet. In contrast, a disk with a surface density gradient proportional to $r^{-5.5}$ reproduces the Earth/Mars mass ratio but leaves the asteroid belt in a dynamical state that is far colder than the real belt. We conclude that no disk profile can simultaneously explain the structure of the terrestrial planets and asteroid belt.

The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed substantial stress on military medicine, and lay and professional press accounts have raised awareness of the effects on military GME. To date, however, objective data on military GME quality remains sparse., OBJECTIVE: Determine the accreditation status of U.S. military GME programs. Additionally, military GME program data will be compared to national (U.S.) accreditation lengths., DESIGN: Retrospective review of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) data., PARTICIPANTS: All military-sponsored core programs in specialties with at least three residencies were included. Military-affiliated but civilian-sponsored programs were excluded., OUTCOME MEASURES: The current and past cycle data were used for the study. For each specialty, the current mean accreditation length and the net change in cycle was calculated. National mean accreditation lengths by specialty for 2005 to 2006 were obtained from the ACGME. Comparison between the overall mean national and military accreditation lengths was performed with a z test. All other comparisons employed descriptive statistics., RESULTS: Ninety-nine military programs in 15 specialties were included in the analysis. During the study period, 1 program was newly accredited, and 6 programs had accreditation withdrawn or were closed. The mean accreditation length of the military programs was 4.0 years. The overall national mean for the same specialties is 3.5 years (p < 0.01). In previous cycles, 68% of programs had accreditation of 4 years or longer, compared to 70% in the current cycle, while 13% had accreditation of 2 years or less in the previous cycle compared to 14% in the current cycle. Ten (68%) of the military specialties had mean accreditation lengths greater than the national average, while 5 (33%) were below it. Ten (68%) specialties had stable or improving cycle lengths when compared to previous cycles., CONCLUSION: Military GME accreditation cycle lengths are, overall, longer than national averages. Trends show many military programs are experiencing either stable or slightly lengthening accreditation compared to previous cycles. A few specialties show a declining trend.

Participants were sent a questionnaire asking about their perceived needs relating to peacekeeping deployments from April 1991 to October 2000. Results: Results indicate that about two-thirds of peacekeepers spoke about their experiences. Most turned to informal networks, such as peers and family members, for support. Those who were highly distressed reported talking to medical and welfare services. Overall, speaking about experiences was associated with less psychological distress. Additionally, two thirds of the sample was in favour of a formalised psychological debriefing on return to the UK.

He raises a fundamental question about the aesthete's creed: how can art, which is imbued with good and evil, be both aesthetically beautiful and morally destructive? Lord Henry Wotton uses Wilde's language of paradox and the circular and contradictory logic of The Critic as Artist, but he cannot be taken simply as Wilde's mouthpiece. He ultimately challenges the basic premise of the book, that of transformation. Dorian and Basil Hallward also reveal aspects of Wilde's psyche. Basil through his portrait and Lord Henry through his word painting both recreate Dorian in their own image and likeness. This narcissism, whether linguistic or sexual, acts as a central metaphor for indulging in sterile and fruitless actions. Wilde compounds his book with not one but three versions of the Faust legend to reinforce this point. The Picture of Dorian Gray is at once an attack on dualism (the soul/body, art/life split) and an exposure of the aesthetic attempt at reconciliation as a widening of that split. Dans le roman The Picture of Dorian Gray, Wilde examine franchement les consequences de l'echange d'une conscience ethique pour une conscience esthetique. II pose une question fondamentale au suject du credo de l'esthete: comment peut Tart, penetre du bien et du mal, etre a la fois beau et destructif de la moralite? Lord Henry Wotton se sert de la langue de paradoxe et de la iogique circulaire et contradictoire de The Critic as Artist, mais il n'est pas simplement le porte parole de Wilde. Lord Henry enfin defie la premisse centrale du roman, celle de transformation. Dorian Gray et Basil Hallward revelent aussi certains aspects du psycholgie de Wilde. Basil, au moyen de son portrait, et Lord Henry, au moyen de sa peinture verbakem reconstruisent Dorian selon leurs memes images. Cette narcissisme, linguistique ou sexuelle, fait fonction d'une metaphore centrale de s'adonner aux actes steriles. Pour accenetuer ce point dans le roman, Wilde emploie pas une, mais trois versions de la legende de Faust.

In the text, Dorian Gray was innocent boy who doesn't realize his own beauty, looking at his portrait by Vasil and being indulged in his beauty. In the influence of Henry, Dorian and his picture become narcissistic doubles. The portrait isn't a kind of representation, with the reproduction through painter's personal emotions but Simulacre which gets us not to distinguish the picture from the character. Dorian and his picture are manifested as doubles beyond the realm of men and objects on the basis of Simulacre from Jean Baudrillard. His portrait which causes Dorian to recognize his beauty and to go into Narcissism also brings out impermeable anxiety because of his refusal of the aging process. Sigmund Freud thought that pressure can't generate anxiety, rather anxiety makes more pressure in his earlier works. As one of significant topics in the long philosophy history, Dorian's anxiety bring out climax pressure in Dorian as self who remains in the imaginary and can't enter the symbol, raising multiple questions on subject. He is always young and beautiful externally, but distorted in the mind. Like this, anxiety and fear are inevitable things, at the same time, very fascinating. The Dorian's picture that produces Narcissism and following anxiety goes beyond picture and proceeds into modern Avatar through each characters' power of influence. Firstly, the man who wanted Dorian to become his avatar, influencing him unknowingly and making his picture was Vasil. Henry was the man who dispersed Vasil's affect on Dorian, he started to pull the strings on him. Sometimes, Dorian had impacted on the others like Sybil and Campbell, however, the manipulator that made Dorian his avatar was his portrait. Dorian as incomplete Self came to reach unintentional death himself by stabbing his picture, his double, that has caused every anxiety. The meaning of his death is that young and beautiful Dorian is transformed into an old and ugly man. This shows transposition possibility of self and the other. This text from 19 century holds subversion that makes us search the separate subject seriously in it and modernity that lets us explain double and avatar at a time. In the intersection of the gaze that the picture looks at us and sight that we stare at the other, subject and the others consistently can switch their position and produce newer stories. Double and avatar in the picture of the text contain transgression and substitute for a fixed self under various repressions. Furthermore, it enables us to continue the study on self and the other. Through it, we can get over the limited and narrow-minded point of view, instead of forcing the text to remain within the one or two intolerant categories.", "identifiers": {"issn": "1598-3269"}, "source": "Nineteenth Century Literature in English", "authors": [{"last_name": "\uc774\ud61c\uc9c4"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/narcissistic-double-avatar-picture-dorian-gray-tt-%EB%82%98%EB%A5%B4%EC%8B%9C%EC%8B%9C%EC%A6%98%EC%A0%81%EC%9D%B8-%EB%8D%94%EB%B8%94%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%EC%95%84%EB%B0%94%ED%83%80%EB%A1%9C%EB%8F%84%EB%A6%AC%EC%96%B8-%EA%B7%B8%EB%A0%88%EC%9D%B4%EC%9D%98-%EC%B4%88%EC%83%81", "year": 2009, "type": "journal", "id": "d43bdd71-9af1-3e46-9fb0-e53070017cbc"}, {"title": "The Picture of Oscar Wilde", "abstract": "A staged photograph is used in an attempt to blackmail Oscar Wilde.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79955045662", "pmid": "18843370", "issn": "1476-4687", "doi": "10.1038/455834a"}, "source": "Strand Magazine", "authors": [{"first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Kurland"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/picture-oscar-wilde", "year": 2008, "type": "journal", "id": "deed88af-ef70-3aea-9565-c43ba3822cae"}, {"title": "Oscar wilde bibliography", "abstract": "This is a bibliography of works by Oscar Wilde, a late-Victorian Irish writer.

Impoverished urban areas have always enticed the popular imagination, considered to be places of \u2018otherness\u2019, \u2018moral decay\u2019, \u2018deviant liberty\u2019 or \u2018authenticity\u2019. \u2018Slumming\u2019 has a long tradition in the Global North, for example in Victorian London when the upper classes toured the East End. What is new, however, is its development dynamics and its rapidly spreading popularity across the globe. Township tourism and favela tourism have currently reached mass tourism characteristics in South Africa and in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In other countries of the Global South, slum tourism now also occurs and providers see huge growth potential. While the morally controversial practice of slum tourism has raised much attention and opinionated debates in the media for several years, academic research has only recently started addressing it as a global phenomenon. This edition provides the first systematic overview of the field and the diverse issues connected to slum tourism. This multidisciplinary collection is unique both in its conceptual and empirical breadth. Its chapters indicate that \u2018global slumming\u2019 is not merely a controversial and challenging topic in itself, but also offers an apt lens through which to discuss core concepts in critical tourism studies in a global perspective, in particular: \u2018poverty\u2019, \u2018power\u2019 and \u2018ethics\u2019. Building on research by prolific researchers from ten different countries, the book provides a comprehensive and unique insight in the current empirical, practical and theoretical knowledge on the subject. It takes a thorough and critical review of issues associated with slum tourism, asking why slums are visited, whether they should be visited, how they are represented, who is benefiting from it and in what way. It offers new insights to tourism's role in poverty alleviation and urban regeneration, power relations in contact zones and tourism's cultural and political implications. Drawing on research from four continents and seven different countries, and from multidisciplinary perspectives, this ground-breaking volume will be valuable reading for students, researchers and academics interested in this contemporary form of tourism.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84898767211", "doi": "10.4324/9780203136751", "isbn": "1136487956"}, "source": "Slum Tourism: Poverty, Power and Ethics", "authors": [{"first_name": "Fabian", "last_name": "Frenzel"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/beyond-othering-political-roots-slum-tourism", "year": 2012, "type": "book_section", "id": "b0e6d666-90d5-301b-814c-4da08c3ad134"}, {"title": "Multicultural comics today: A brief introduction", "abstract": "All walks of life are on display in today's alternative and mainstream comic book worlds.1 I do not just mean those politically astute anthropomorphic lions that strut through a U.S.-invaded, bombed-out Iraq, as seen in Brian K. Vaughan and Niko Henrichon's Pride of Baghdad (2006).2 Off the cuff , I think of: the dyspeptic Asian American Ben Tanaka in Adrian Tomine's Shortcomings (2007); the bipolar Latino Omar Guerrero in Wilfred Santiago's In My Darkest Hour (2004); the angsty Latino suburbanite teen Miguel in Gilbert Hernandez's Sloth (2006); former Gotham City police detective and lesbian Latina Renee Montoya as love interest of Kate Kane (Batwoman) in Geoff Johns and Grant Morrison's maxi-series 52 (issues 1-52, 2006-2007); the Japanese \u00e9migr\u00e9 superhero Sunfire, out of the closet as a lesbian in Judd Winick's Exiles (issue 11, 2001); and Asian American Dupli-Kate, her brother Multi-Paul, and well-heeled black Black Samson in Robert Kirkman's Invincible (issues 2 and 6, 2003). With author-artists at the helm like Los Bros. Hernandez, Santiago, Kirkman, and Winick, to name a few, we see a multiplicity of shades, colors, and sexual orientations expressed in comic book storyworlds.3 Today, for instance when Winick receives fan mail critical of superheroes like Sunfi re or the introduction of Green Lantern's assistant Terry Berg as queer (Green Lantern, vol. 3, issue 137, 2001), he has to ask, \"Which social agenda are you complaining about? Is it the gay people? or the black people or the Asian people? Aft er a while, it doesn't look like a social agenda. Th is is the world we live in\" (Gustines, \"Straight (and Not) Out of the Comics,\" 25). Of course, the world we live in off ers an infinite array of possible experiences and identities for a given author-artist to aesthetically reframe and transform into comic book storyworlds. And this is exactly what author-artists do. They take from the real world and fictional worlds: author-artists of color talk about real, biographical experiences living at the margins of a xenophobic society informing their comics as much as they talk of the influence of fiction, film, and art. In the creation of Rocketo (2006), for instance, Latino Frank Espinosa's fictional world is as much an allegory of the Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9 experience as it is an engagement and radical revision of Homer's Odyssey. (See Aldama's Your Brain on Latino Comics.) Th is isn't too surprising, given that author-artists of color have the capacity to imagine and feel outside of themselves. While categories used by academics and the media like Latino, Asian American, or African American, and so on, might be useful at fi rst to make these author-artists' work visible, at the end of the day, they want not only to have their work judged by the standard of the great comic book author-artists, but also not to have their talent and imagination squeezed into only one identity-politics box. As Espinosa declares, \"If all we do is just talk about one experience in our lives, we will remain trapped\" (Your Brain on Latino Comics, 165). Th ese categories ultimately force the massive creative range of author-artists of color, as Gilbert Hernandez tells Derek Parker Royal in an interview, \"back into a kind of ghetto\" (\"Palomar and Beyond,\" 227). Why shouldn't Latinos or Asian Americans or African Americans or Native Americans be writing, as Espinosa asks, \"the new Lord of the Rings, the new Star Wars, the new Harry Potter?\" (Your Brain on Latino Comics, 165). There are many other author-artists of color who share this sentiment and act upon it. For instance, while Roberta Gregory has created a biographical comic book vignette \"California Girl\" (collected in Roadstrips: A Graphic Journey across America) that touches on experiences growing up Mexican and American in the 1950s Mexicans could only swim on certain days at her public pool her eponymous protagonist \"Bitchy Bitch\" of her trademark comic book has nothing to do with this experience; in fact, she's about as white, racist, and bigoted as they get. And we can say the same of n tive Hawaiian R. Kikuo Johnson's non-ethnic-identifi able protagonist in Night Fisher (2005). In both we see author-artists of color place a large distance between their own biographical experience and the characters and storyworld they create. Any and all comic book author-artists should be free to create any type of storyworld populated by any type of character. There has been a tradition, how-ever, of gatekeeping race-and ethnic-identified experiences and characters. This said, steps have been made toward widening the scope of comic book representations. In the United States, in the wake of civil rights activism, we see a first big growth spurt in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when characters of color began to see the light of day. Behemoths like DC and Marvel, as well as the little guys publishing \"underground comix,\" or others, were off ering more than the typical chiseled white-guy comic book fare. I will leave it to Leonard Rifas in his essay \"Race and Comix\" in this collection to provide the context and specific detail for this shift in the underground comix world. As far as DC and Marvel go, we do see the making of a handful of African American, Latino, Asian American, and Native American superheroes. Several highlights from the late 1960s and the 1970s include: Stan Lee and Gene Colan's inventing in 1969 of the Harlem street thug Sam \"Snap\" Wilson as the Falcon (Captain America, vol. 1, issue 117). In 1972, Archie Goodwin and John Romita Sr. brought to life the Shaft-blaxploitation-styled superhero Carl Lucas in the series Luke Cage, Hero for Hire. A year later Marvel featured the African American day-walker vampire Blade as a supporting character in Tomb of Dracula (issue 10); this was followed by Blade holding his own in a fifty-sixpage solo story in Marvel Preview (issue 3). (See Elizabeth Nixon's \"'It ain't John Shaft ': Marvel Gets Multicultural in The Tomb of Dracula\" in this volume.) In 1977, comic book readers came across one of the arguably more complex superheroes of the day: using his athletic prowess to get out of the ghetto, Jefferson Pierce is a high-school teacher by day and the bioelectric-charged Black Lightning by night (Black Lightning, vol. 1, issue 1). The 1980s and 1990s saw other notable superheroes of color arrive on the scene, including: Steve Englehart and Joe Staton's creating of a team of immortals called the Chosen, as part of their series Millennium, who are recruited to \"advance the human race\" (issues 1, p.4, 1988). The team includes, among others, an Australian aboriginal woman, Bett y Clawman; a Maoist from mainland China, Xiang Po; an Inuit, Tom Kalmaku; an Afro-Caribbean Brit, Celia Windward; and Gregorio de la Vega, born and raised Peruvian. In 1997 Christopher Priest (writer) and ChrisCross (artist) created the African American pro-basketball player Coltrane \"Trane\" Walker as the superhero Xer\u00f8, who performs a sort of white minstrelsy (blond-haired wig and whiteface mask) to sleuth out and foil espionage operations that threaten the nation. While in this period we see African-American-identified superheroes picking up the relative lion's share of representation, there were several notable Asians, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, including the Japanese-identified Sunfire (X-Men, vol. 1, issue 64, 1970). There has been a tradition of Native Americans appearing as sidekicks, the easily disposable, and the preternaturally ecological in comics. In mainstream comics, we had, for example, superheroes like Cheyenne William Talltrees, who dons the ceremonial garb of Red Wolf appearing in Avengers (vol. 1, issue 80, 1970), the Apache James Proudstar as Warpath (New Mutants, vol. 1, issue 16, 1984), and his elder brother John Proudstar as Thunderbird, with his super senses, strength, speed, and stamina (Giant-Size X-Men, issue 1, 1975). There have also been some notable Latino superheroes. Marvel introduced Bonita Juarez as Firebird in 1981; DC introduced Paco Ramone as Vibe in 1984, as well as Rafael Sandoval as El Diablo in 1989. In 1993 Latino author-artist Ivan Velez Jr. illed out with rich complexity a team of queer and straight Latino superheroes (Dominican, Puerto Rican, Afro-Hispanic, among others) in the Milestone series Blood Syndicate. \u00a9 2010 by University of Texas Press.

The fact that comics tell diverse, interesting stories makes them no more 'literary' than film, opera or, indeed, soap opera. It seems perverse for scholars bent on demonstrating the efficacy of visual storytelling to claim that it is storytelling which makes comics literary, thus aligning narrative in general with the verbal medium. This article sets forth a more scrupulous framework for approaching comics as literature. Through a close analysis of various examples, this article challenges the habitual sidelining of text within comics. It demonstrates: first, how comics can be heavily dependent on text; second, how that text can be properly - that is formally - literary; and, third, how the medium can deploy the linguistic element of its content in ways that create literary, textual effects that are in fact unique to the comics medium. In carefully distinguishing between elements such as theme and plotting, which are common to all narrative media, and these truly literary devices, this article ultimately concludes that in order for the comics medium to be given its due as a potentially literary form, proper attention needs to be paid to the way it incorporates literary language. In service of theoretical precision, critics must not confuse narrative properties with literary ones, but must rigorously insist on the correct frame of reference in order to promote serious academic study of this diverse and complex narrative form.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84942014125", "issn": "20403232", "doi": "10.1386/stic.2.2.263_1"}, "source": "Studies in Comics", "authors": [{"first_name": "HANNAH", "last_name": "MIODRAG"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/narrative-language-comicsasliterature", "year": 2012, "type": "generic", "id": "7160f5bf-8eae-3f8d-9ed0-78dcb941cb45"}, {"title": "Understanding Comics", "abstract": "A comic book about comic books.

Asked if she would be interested in decorating her room with Spider-Man paraphernalia, the litt le girl exclaimed, \"Spider- Man is for boys!\" A proper feminist, my friend was perturbed by this assertion, and she tried to tease out the logic behind the claim, only to become more alarmed when her niece said, \"Girls aren't interested in Spider-Man unless he saves them!\" By the time we talked, my friend had recovered from the heart att ack induced by her niece's retro-wilting-flower subjectivity. We agreed nostalgically that the problem is that contemporary girls do not have what infl uenced us in the late 1970s and early 1980s. We have a generation of girls who are inundated with the pleasures of Princess accoutrements, and models of strength such as the superpowered kindergartners the Powerpuff Girls still frame power within the pleasures of girly-girl accessories and tiny, unimposing bodies. However, I must acknowledge that my role model as a child was problematic in her own ways. She was also a princess an Amazon princess but she left the world of the princesses to fi ght evil created by the \"man's world.\" I clearly remember singing in the universal, atonal way of vocally ungift ed children: \"Wonder WOH-MAAAN! WON-der WOH-MAAAAAN!\" Humming the bass beats of the television show theme song, I would begin my daily twirling exercises spinning my body until I felt the giddy combination of light-headed energy and nausea. I was a wild-haired brown child, with a crown of aluminum foil in my hair, mumbling under my breath, twirling with a slightly off-center momentum, ripping something off to reveal the shirt and short ensemble of Wonder Woman underoos. I was oft en alone except for the unseen and voiceless victims and villains who peppered my imaginary world: Wait you Nazis, I am Wonder Woman and I will stop you! My valiant claims were only interrupted by the change in wardrobe from T-shirt to underoos. I begin my contribution to this volume with a personal narrative because of how important the aff ective dimension of revision has been to a number of cultural productions that make racial or ethnic minorities the center of creation. Creators like artist Kerry James Marshall, whom I will discuss in this essay, oft en mine beloved texts for inspiration. Th is inspiration is not only shaped by the pleasure they received from the consumption but the unfulfilled desire to see stories or representations that feature people like themselves. Multicultural superhero comics are oft en quite explicitly marked by this reflexivity. Multicultural superhero comic revisions entail the rich texturing of locale and the cultural context within which the superhero narrative unfolds; an aesthetic attention to the rendering of the racial or ethnic minority body; and a self-consciousness about the process of identification with cultural icons. Th e superhero comics that may have most systematically demonstrated a revision aesthetic were produced by Milestone, a short-lived comics imprint run by African American creators. Their Superman-like hero, Icon, was a black conservative from outer space whose sidekick was a teenage single mother who inspired him to help the community. The superhero group, Blood Syndicate, was an amalgamation of street gangs who became superheroes in the wake of an industrial \"accident\" in a predominantly black neighborhood. The scientist-turned-superhero, Hardware, was cheated out of his intellectual property by a white businessman. These three models flip the script of archetypal kinds of superhero stories, placing the narratives in the context of black history and the challenges facing the black inner city. These thoughtful representations were not available to me when I was young. And I was not a comic book reader until adulthood; thus I was unfamiliar wiThearly black superheroes such as Luke Cage, Black Panther, or even Nubia, the black Wonder Woman who appeared in a few issues in the 1970s. Wonder Woman was nonetheless both productive and challenging for my selfimage. I was no Lynda Carter, with alabaster skin and long, flowing hair, but the romance of power and agency remained with me. In putting on the underoos, I could imagine a validated outlet for my strong personality. While heroes represent to adults what they stand for, researchers have suggested that heroes help children define their place in society and construct ideal roles for themselves to play.1 However, even as Wonder Woman represented a particular ideal of women being able to have and demonstrate their power, I was also quite physically dissimilar from my hero. Adopting Wonder Woman was one of my first clearly remembered acts of seeing myself in a cultural representation that was clearly not meant to address anyone who looked like me or had my history. However, identifi cation is a complex process that cannot be easily described as a function of people's att achment to those most like them, and superheroes may illustrate the vagaries of identifi catory practices better than many cultural productions. No real person can have the att ributes of the superhero, and they offer the fantasy that with a cape, mask, or pair of underoos, the wearer can transform herself into another person. Comic book superheroes have traditionally off ered the fantasy of outsiders transforming into ideal citizens, making them ideal Rorschachs for people of color. People can identify with those like themselves and with idealized versions of themselves. Superheroes have given the world both representations. Nevertheless, for many people of color in the United States, the experience of consuming comic book heroism in print, television, and film has involved reconciling themselves to representing the antithesis of heroic ideals. Even in a twenty-first-century casting of a new Wonder Woman, would anyone imagine that Hollywood producers would cast a black or Asian actress in that role? Comic creators have imagined people of color in these roles, but their presence is always short-lived. While identifi cation with fictions involves imaginative leaps and textual poaching for all consumers, people of color often must negotiate a string of representations (hypermasculine men and emasculated women) that set them apart from heroism. Hence, a truly radical departure from traditional representations of superheroes requires sidestepping the exaggerated stereotypes of blacks in mainstream comics. Another means of revision is the creating of the self-conscious comic book that foregrounds the hybrid nature of black identifi catory practices that draw from multiple cultures. For example, African American cartoonist Aaron McGruder's popular comic strip The Boondocks (1996-2006) mixed black nationalist rhetoric with a Japanese manga and anime aesthetic. In providing radically different models of the body in black comics, artists began to create an iconography contrasting with the damaging history of the visual representation of black bodies. In this essay I discuss an unusual comic book text that provides a wholly other comic book aesthetic an exhibit by artist Kerry James Marshall and the performance piece derived from it, Every Beat of My Heart. Marshall first began this project with Rythm Mastr, an exhibit, blending African, African American, and traditional superhero narratives, for the Carnegie Museum International show in 1999. In 2008, he blended the comic book project with a community performance piece using the Japanese form of Bunraku puppetry at the Wexner Center in Columbus, Ohio. He makes an intervention into the absence of black bodies in superhero texts by presenting alternative body models for superhero narratives. His work illustrates the kind of cultural fusion informing some black comic artists' productions: a fusion that illustrates how the future of black comics is one that moves away from purely black nationalist, Afrocentric, or traditional superhero narratives and instead embraces the hybrid subjectivity of blacks in the African diaspora. His project is instructive, not only through what it offers as an alternative model, but by the absences in his vision of black heroic narratives. \u00a9 2010 by University of Texas Press.

We illustrate this concretely with respect to extracts taken from Ang Lee's Hulk (2003), a film we consider unique in its particular appropriation of expressive resources from the comic medium. Hulk is often been singled out in discussions of the relations between comics and film because many of the design decisions taken in the film evoke aspects of the comic page. Here, we argue that its use of the resources of comics goes substantially beyond 'evocation': Hulk is best considered a highly experimental hybrid, taking resources that were initially essentially comics based and 'translating' these filmically in order to extend the medium of film in interesting ways. We show this in two respects: first, we consider the filmic deployment of comicbook conventions for expressing movement; second, we establish that the film's use of split-screen techniques extends the ability of film to express narrative continuity and connection between perspectives.

To what extent, however, is it pertinent to our understanding of the contribution of women to British cinema history? Colonial historians and postcolonial critics have long alerted us to the importance of empire to British film policy as well as British national identity in cinema. Film emerging at the height of the British Empire arguably links the history of British cinema inextricably with that of empire, an issue that is currently being addressed. By bringing the empire into the frame of British cinema, debates around national film policies, production, distribution, and exhibition become more complicated, particularly in relation to how cinema circulated internationally. British men were filming all over the world from 1896, and throughout the first half of the twentieth century film was used widely in the empire. While commercial imperatives drove a lot of these activities, British policy documents on the use of film in the empire from the mid-1920s to the 1950s show that government officials, policy makers, educators, missionaries, conscious of the effect of American films on British subjects in the empire, promoted film as an instructional and educational medium and as a form of propaganda. We know a lot about British players in the colonies: from R. W. Paul filming the South African War (1899-1902) (formerly known as the Anglo-Boer War), Basil Wright's documentary work for the Empire Marketing Board, and Alexander and Zoltan Korda's empire feature film productions. There were also those working for the Colonial Film Units operating in Africa, the West Indies, Jamaica and the Caribbean, and other parts of the empire, with the Colonial Film Unit in London headed up by William Sellers and George Pearson, who developed what became known as a primitive style  of filmmaking for \"adults who cannot read or write, primitive in customs and environment.\" A women's film history project in Britain and Ireland therefore needs to take these histories into account and assess what opportunities, if any, the British Empire afforded women and how British women used film to advance the colonial project. Revealing the extent of filmmaking activities of women in the empire is not an easy task and will require the dedication, innovative historiography, and inventive research methods that researchers have already developed for the Women and the Silent Screen and Women's Film History Project. But in spite of the difficulties of tracing and identifying sources and attributing authorship, it is possible to find in existing historiography evidence of women working in film within the colonial space. One of the main openings for women to work in film was with film companies in Britain producing educational, documentary, and instructional film. In the 1920s and 1930s companies such as British Instructional, then Gaumont-British Instructional, produced film not only for the home country but on a large scale for the empire. Mary Field, education manager and then a producer for British Instructional, moved to the educational unit of Gaumont-British Instructional, which made educational films, particularly for schools. While better known for her work on the Secrets of Nature (GB, 1922-33) and Secrets of Life series (GB, 1934-50), Field also counted among her credits the Secrets of India series (GB, 1934, reedited and released as the Indian Town Studies series [GB, 1937]) and the Empire Story in Cartoon series (GB, 1939), the latter made for children. She was awarded an OBE for her work in educational and children's entertainment film in 1954.

This article argues that this variation can be explained by the characteristics of the historical process of the spread of mass literacy in each of these countries. Catalan national identity is not salient in French Catalonia because the first generation of mass literates became so under French rule. In contrast, the nonexistence of a scholastic revolution in Spain prior to the beginning of the 20th century allowed for the successful sowing of a Catalan national identity during the first decades of that century.

Among the various forms of motion sickness, air sickness has a significant impact on aircrew readiness and is often a cause for the grounding of aircrew. Unfortunately, standards for clinical testing to accurately predict the sensitivity of each individual to air-sickness are currently lacking. Furthermore, pharmacological prevention is contraindicated for aircrews, whose cognitive tasks involve a high level of vigilance. Therefore, a number of Air Forces have developed their own rehabilitation programmes to counteract air-sickness effects on flight personnel. These programmes may differ in several aspects, such as their duration, instruments used, costs and the technical characteristics of the rehabilitation team. However, reports in the specialized literature, refer to high rates of success, despite the above-mentioned differences. In the autumn of 2000, the Italian Air Force (ITAF) also began its own rehabilitation programme for air-sickness desensitisation. The programme was developed at the Aerospace Medicine Department of the ITAF Flight Test Centre, at the Pratica di Mare Air Force Base, Italy. The ITAF rehabilitation course lasts two weeks, and candidates are first classified according to their clinical history and to their reaction to the Coriolis Stress Test. Thereafter, subjects undergo a personalized desensitisation programme, involving increasingly more intense nauseogenic stimuli by means of various devices. At the same time, a psychological approach, based on autogenous training and cognitive-behavioural therapy, is adopted. The present report refers to data from 17 subjects treated from January 2001.

The costs of corrosion, as well as its structural impact, become significantly larger with aging fleets. To date, corrosion has been managed via periodic inspections, with the assumption that all corrosion damages would be found and repaired prior to becoming critical. This very expensive approach seems unsuitable for all aircraft parts and does not consider the ~ucmral impacts of existing corrosion. Thus, a \"predict and manage\" philosophy must be integrated with the development of smart devices, in order to conduct overhaul inspections only when and where necessary. Based on a non-destructive approach, this brief review paper provides a summary of monitoring techniques being selected to be tested and eventually applied on Italian Air Force (IAF) Fleet aircraft. Early corrosion damage detection in real time and over a period of deployment/service is the goal, \"smart find and fix\" philosophy and \"hidden monitoring\" strategy are the tools. INTRODUCTIONDue to economic constraints, new procurements of aircraft are being reduced or limited causing long term prospects in renewing fleets. Thus, the age of the military and civilian air vehicles is dramatically increasing and increased maintenance and repair capability are required. In 1992, the U.S. Navy introduced a new term to the maintenance word, defining the Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) as \"maintenance based on objective evidence of actual or predictable failure of a ship's installed systems or components ''~. To date, this sentence is being accel:ted and translated in the following strategy\" Health Monitoring Devices (HMDs) should play the primary role in highlighting the \"objective evidence\", and the ready maintenance should be assured by means of a Health Management System (HMS) generating waming signals. About HMDs, they can act as diagnosis tools, detecting strains, impacts, corrosion, cracks, deformation, and prognosis tools, monitoring loads and fatigue life and applying finite element analysis on every damage site. Hence, HMDs new features such as structure health signature, strain survey, Finite Elements Analysis (FEA) predictability assessment and validation can improve actual Nondestructive Testing Manuals procedures toward the damage detection in hidden places, where up to now traditional inspections don't apply on inaccessible areas. It is easy predictable that HMS' approval could not only improve safety and airworthiness, but also reduce the whole life cycle cost avoiding unnecessary inspections. Actually, no Italian Air Force aircraft is monitored by means of HMDs.The need of detecting aircraft corrosion is one of the driving forces that push up the whole maintenance circuit costs. Taking in consideration the direct maintenance cost due to corrosion and the periodic inspection performed on the U.S. Air Force Fleets during fiscal year 1997, is estimated to cost $800 million, with an average estimate $100,000 per aircraft 2. There does not exist an analogous study for the Italian Air Force fleet, but the average cost per aircraft is estimated to be close to the American value. Based on periodic and overhaul inspections, the actual \"find and fix\" strategy requires both scheduled paint removal and classical visual and non destructive tests execution: moreover, increasing more and more maintenance expenses. Also, parts are substituted according to their lifecycle requirements. In order to assess if the actual inspections ensure the required airworthiness, Italian Air Force developed (since 1994) the Corrosion Control Register Program (", "authors": [{"first_name": "Lorenzo", "last_name": "Aiello"}], "source": "Corrosion 2004", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/condition-based-corrosion-health-monitoring-italian-air-force-prospect", "year": 2004, "keywords": ["aircraft", "corrosivity sensors", "health monitoring devices", "hidden areas corrosion", "microwave detectors"], "type": "generic", "id": "fb0b1a23-b0af-3d53-9372-c4ee7b956c6e"}, {"title": "Air force world", "abstract": "Merri M.

Second, the visualization had to be eloquent to a nonexpert user. This was achieved by first designing and computing a finite-element analysis (FEA) simulation of the impact between the aircraft and the top 20 stories of the building, and then by visualizing the FEA results with a state-of-the-art commercial animation system. The visualization was enabled by an automatic translator that converts the simulation data into an animation system 3D scene. We built upon a previously developed translator. The translator was substantially extended to enable and control visualization of fire and of disintegrating elements, to better scale with the number of nodes and number of states, to handle beam elements with complex profiles, and to handle smoothed particle hydrodynamics liquid representation.

In general, progressive collapse occurs when one or more relatively small load-carrying elements fail, and produce a progression of collapse that further leads to a global failure. There are few practical ways to reduce the probability of progressive collapse. By strengthening the structure's redundancy, continuity and ductility, the structure will be less likely to fail due to removal of few load-carrying elements. In this paper, a basic progressive collapse theory was studied using the World Trade Center towers as an example. First, a missing column analysis was performed with SAP 2000, a structural analysis program, to determine the alternate load paths and study the overall behavior of the structure. Overstressed elements were identified and studied in detail using the virtual work diagram and the plastic analysis theory. A second-order analysis was also performed to determine the likelihood of a progressive collapse when the existing loads are placed on the displaced joints.", "identifiers": {"isbn": "9780542635038; 0542635038"}, "source": "ProQuest Dissertations and Theses", "authors": [{"first_name": "Jung Min", "last_name": "Lee"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/progressive-collapse-analysis-world-trade-center-towers", "year": 2006, "keywords": ["0543:Civil engineering", "Applied sciences", "Civil engineering"], "type": "thesis", "id": "f895ad3a-0e62-3c00-a114-187af414667d"}, {"title": "A theory for the collapse of the World Trade Center", "abstract": "Two airplanes of type Boeing 767 flew into the Twin Towers in the morning of September 11th 2001.

When the temperature reached 750-800 ??C, the huge amount of aluminium melt managed to stream down to the lower floors. There it came in contact with water from the automatic sprinkler devices and possibly other sources. This encounter resulted in a series of fierce explosions due to the generation of hydrogen gas and local heating to high temperatures well above 1200 ??C.

Natural gas is a combustible mixture of hydrocarbon gases, primarily methane but also heavier gaseous hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane and butane. Unlike other fossil fuels, natural gas is clean burning and emits lower levels of potentially harmful by-products into the air. Therefore, it is considered as one of the cleanest, safest, and most useful of all energy sources applied in variety of residential, commercial and industrial fields. The book is organized in 25 chapters that cover various aspects of natural gas research: technology, applications, forecasting, numerical simulations, transport and risk assessment.

Projects to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) have been proposed-cumulatively accounting for about 12.5% of current U.S. natural gas production-and are at varying stages of regulatory approval. Projects require federal approval according to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. '717b) with the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission being the lead authorizing agencies. Pipeline exports, which accounted for 94% of all exports of U.S. produced natural gas in 2010, are also likely to rise. What effect exporting natural gas will have on U.S. prices is the central question in the debate of whether to export or not to export. A significant rise in U.S. natural gas exports would likely put upwards pressure on domestic prices, but the magnitude of any rise is currently unclear. There are numerous factors that will affect prices: export volumes, economic growth, differences in local markets, and government regulations, among others. With today's natural gas prices relatively low compared to global prices and historically low for the United States, producers are looking for new markets for their natural gas. Producers contend that increased exports will not raise prices significantly as there is ample supply to meet domestic demand, and there will be the added benefits of increased revenues, trade, and jobs, and less flaring. Consumers of natural gas, who are being helped by the low prices, fear prices will rise if natural gas is exported. Electric power generation represents potentially the greatest increase in natural gas consumption in the U.S. economy, primarily for environmental reasons. Natural gas emits much less carbon dioxide and other pollutants than coal when combusted. Other types of consumption are not likely to increase natural gas demand domestically for a long time. Use in the transportation sector to displace oil is likely to be small because expensive new infrastructure and technologies would be required. There is discussion of a possible revival of the U.S. petrochemicals sector, but the potential extent of a change is unclear. Getting natural gas to markets where it can be consumed, whether domestically or internationally, is the industry's biggest challenge. Infrastructure constraints, environmental regulations, and other factors will influence how the market adjusts to balance supply and demand. Environmental groups are split regarding natural gas use, with some favoring increased use to curb emissions of certain pollutants, while others oppose expanded use of natural gas because it is not as clean as renewable forms of energy, such as wind or solar. The use of hydraulic fracturing to produce shale gas has also raised concerns among environmental groups particularly concerned with its possible impacts on water quality. The possibility of a significant increase in U.S. natural gas exports will factor into ongoing debates on the economy, energy independence, climate change, and energy security. As the proposed projects continue to develop, policymakers are likely to receive more inquiries about these projects. \u00a9 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Within this region, bioclimatic regimes range from humid tropical rainforest to desert on the lowlands, from subtropical dry and subtropical humid environments on the lower slopes of the Andes to humid temperate and subtemperate forests, subparamo, and paramo at high elevations in the Andes. This region is inhabited by 61 species of Eleiitherodactylus, each of which is treated in an account that includes a diagnosis, description or reference to a description, coloration in life, natural history, and distribution. Nine new species are described, and E. alberchi is placed in the synonymy of E. surdus. Records for E. taeniatits in Ecuador are based on misidentifications. All morphological characters used in the identification and systematics of Eleutherodactylus are defined and illustrated, and a key to the identification of the species in western Ecuador is provided. Nine communities containing six to fifteen species of Eleiitherodactylus were analyzed with respect to species diversity, rank and relative abundance of species, body size, and microhabitat untilization. Fidelity of species to bioclimatic regimes is rather low; the highest degree of endemism is 26% in the humid subtropical regime. Among the Eleutherodactyhis in western Ecuador, 32 species are endemic to the region, and 24 other species reach the southern limits of their distributions there. Altitudinally, the greatest number of species is between 1 200 m and 2200 m. Sizes of distributions are large at low elevations compared to smaller ranges of species in the Andes. Patterns of speciation include upland vicariants of lowland relatives, latitudinal replacement of sister taxa in the Andes, and trans-Andean relatives.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-70349345318", "pmid": "2608531", "issn": "0193-7766", "isbn": "0893380547", "doi": "10.5962/bhl.title.7951"}, "source": "The University of Kansas Natural History Museum", "authors": [{"first_name": "J D", "last_name": "Lynch"}, {"first_name": "W E", "last_name": "Duellman"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/frogs-genus-eleutherodactylus-leptodactylidae-western-ecuador-systematics-ecology-biogeography", "year": 1997, "keywords": ["Biogeography", "Community ecology", "Ecuador", "Eleutherodactylus", "Leptodactylidae", "New species", "Pacific versant", "Taxonomy"], "type": "book", "id": "c4cb5ebf-e8e7-3808-b957-e87c9141e266"}, {"title": "Standard operating procedure for the benthic macroinvertebrate laboratory", "abstract": "Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein\u2212protein docking tools.

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations.

AF is most commonly associated with nonvalvular cardiovascular disease and is especially frequent among the elderly. The annual risk for stroke in patients with AF is approximately 5% with a wide range depending on the presence of additional risk factors. For patients who cannot successfully be converted and maintained in normal sinus rhythm (NSR), antithrombotic therapy is an effective method for preventing stroke. The 2 drugs which are indicated for stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF are warfarin and aspirin. For primary prevention, warfarin reduces the risk of stroke approximately 68%. Aspirin therapy is less effective, resulting in a 20 to 30% risk reduction. Combination therapy with aspirin and low intensity warfarin adjusted to an International Normalised Ratio (INR) of 1.2 to 1.5 has not been shown to be superior to standard intensity warfarin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0. In patients with AF and a prior history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), the absolute risk reduction with warfarin is even greater because of the high risk of stroke in this population. In contrast, aspirin has not been shown to significantly reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF when used for secondary prevention. When appropriately managed, warfarin is associated with a low risk of major bleeding. In controlled trials of highly selected patients, the annual rate of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) with warfarin was approximately 0.3%. Studies have shown that specialty anticoagulation clinics can achieve similar low rates of major bleeding. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to the general population. Factors which have been identified as predictors of bleeding include advanced age, number of medications and most importantly, the intensity of anticoagulation. INR values above 4.0 have been associated with an increased risk of major bleeding while values below 2.0 have been associated with thrombosis. Slow careful dosage titration, regular laboratory monitoring and patient education can substantially reduce the risk of complications. In patients with AF, antithrombotic therapy has been shown to be cost effective. For high risk patients, warfarin is the most cost-effective therapy, provided the risks fur bleeding are minimised. In contrast, aspirin is the most cost-effective agent for low risk patients. Current practice guidelines for stroke prophylaxis recommend warfarin (target INR 2.5; range 2.0 to 3.0) for AF patients at high risk for stroke including those over 75 years of age or younger patients with additional risk factors. Aspirin should be reserved for low risk patients or those unable to take warfarin. Although these recommendations are strongly supported by the clinical trial evidence, studies show that many patients are not receiving appropriate antithrombotic therapy. In particular, warfarin is underutilised in high risk elderly patients. Additional studies are needed to identify barriers that prevent implementation of the clinical trial findings into clinical practice.

Jeff Kramer of the El Paso County Sheriff's Department. Deputies are trying to find James Lohr, 47, and Thomas Guolee, 31, Kramer said. Both are associated with the white supremacist prison gang known as the 211 Crew, he said. They should be considered armed and dangerous, Kramer said. \"Because of the circumstances where you have violent folks who are willing to execute a DOC official, we don't want to underestimate these guys,\" Kramer said. Investigators have said the main suspect in the killing of Clements and pizza delivery driver Nathan Leon is parolee Evan Ebel, a member of the 211 Crew who died in a shootout with Texas lawmen on March 21. A 9mm Smith & Wesson found with Ebel's body in Texas was used to kill Clements, investigators said. Kramer did not say what role Lohr and Guolee might have played in the killing or why they are being sought, but officials said they believe the two men had been in contact with Ebel before the two slayings. Lohr has an extensive criminal record dating back to 1985, including burglary, domestic violence, escape, theft and fraud, according to court records. He has two warrants issued for his arrest for bail violation and a protection-order violation. Guolee has an extensive criminal record dating back to 2000, including assault, fraud, robbery, forgery and menacing, court records show. He is currently on parole in Colorado's southwest region, according to Colorado Department of Corrections records. Guolee's Facebook page says he is married, and there are multiple pictures of him with a young girl. Lohr is described as 6 feet tall, 160 pounds, with blond hair, brown eyes and several tattoos. Guolee is described as 5-feet-9, 160 pounds, with brown hair, blue eyes and several tattoos. The alert issued by the sheriff's department did not list a vehicle for the men or indicate their possible direction of travel, but Kramer said authorities believe the men could be headed to Nevada or Texas. A close acquaintance said Wednesday night that Lohr grew up in a strict Baptist home in Pennsylvania where he wasn't allowed to listen to rock music. Lohr, who has four children, joined the army and was stationed at Fort Carson, the acquaintance said. \"He got involved in meth, and he changed. He was really irresponsible,\" she said. \"He became violent.\" He was arrested several times for beating his wife and the couple got divorced, she said. In the 1980s, he stole a motorcycle. The acquaintance said when he went to prison he joined a white supremacist gang for protection. \"I never thought of it as being dangerous,\" she said. \"This is really weird. This is like 'The Twilight Zone.' \" Guolee's father, Phil, said prison turned his son into the man he is. \"He has been in there since he was 18. He couldn't get any help, couldn't get a good lawyer, couldn't get anything for him in Colorado,\" said Phil Guolee, who lives in Wisconsin. There were rumors his son was a member of a prison gang, but Phil Guolee said he was not positive about that. Thomas Guolee told his father that he was bipolar and that he was not allowed to have his medication in prison. \"They railroaded him,\" Phil Guolee said. \"That's all they ever did.\" Authorities have been searching for any ties in the Clements investigation between Ebel and the 211 Crew. DOC sources have said the state is investigating whether a move of several 211 Crew leaders from Sterling to Buena Vista Correctional Complex to break up their power base might have prompted the attack on Clements. DOC spokeswoman Alison Morgan said Wednesday she had not heard about El Paso County's search for the two white supremacists \u2014 one of whom is a DOC parolee \u2014 and she said she did not have an immediate comment. The 211 Crew's founder and reputed \"shot-caller\" Benjamin Davis, 38, was moved to Buena Vista from Sterling. Davis appeared in Denver District Court on Wednesday after an appeal. A judge resentenced him to 108 years on a racketeering conviction from 2007. Ebel, 28, was released on mandatory parole from Sterling Correctional Facility on Jan. 28, and DOC documents show he removed his ankle monitoring device on March 14. Ebel is suspected of killing Leon on March 17 and Clements at his Monument home on March 19. A clerical error in the 11th Judicial District allowed Ebel to be released from prison Jan. 28 without serving any additional time for a 2008 conviction for assaulting a prison guard, despite the terms of a plea agreement that called for Ebel to serve a consecutive four-year term. In addition to the clerical error, Ebel was released nearly four months early as a result of a 2011 law that allowed him and others to earn time off their sentences for time spent in administrative segregation.", "authors": [{"first_name": "Kirk", "last_name": "Mitchell"}, {"first_name": "Sadie", "last_name": "Gurman"}, {"first_name": "Ryan", "last_name": "Parker"}], "source": "The Denver Post", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/211-crew-members-sought-el-paso-county-tom-clements-murder-case", "year": 2013, "keywords": ["211 Crew", "9mm Smith & Wesson", "Shot Caller", "Twilight Zone"], "type": "newspaper_article", "id": "c3ff1c36-3c3a-3e82-b295-e5e5820335b9"}, {"title": "Abused or neglected kids more likely to have impaired body and brain - The Denver Post", "abstract": "News Politics Sports Business Entertainment Lifestyles Opinion Travel Your\u00a0Hub Blogs (http://www.denverpost.com/business?

The book covers the victims, then looks at the Ripper correspondence, box outs discussing the Dear Boss and Lusk letter and things such as a microscope of the type Dr Openshaw might have used. The book moves on to profiles of the Ripper, starting with Dr. Bond\u2019s analysis and then the FBI profile created in 1988. In the course of this brief but well-written trot through the case there are a few mistakes, the most serious, perhaps, is in a box out on page 37 where Major Smith is called the Commissioner of the City of London Police. And on page 31 we\u2019re told that the discovery of the apron in the yard at 29 Hanbury Street directed attention to John Pizer. These are small mistakes which won\u2019t seriously mislead young readers, but they are slightly surprising given the obvious responsibility the publisher felt towards accuracy by bringing on board a content consultant. The chapter on suspects kicks off with Montague John Druitt and Ms Anderson very quickly gets into a spot of bother by claiming that Macnaghten named \u201cthe top three people suspected by police at the time of the murders\u201d. Obviously one appreciates that the most important thing when telling this story for children is not to over-complicate, and it isn\u2019t easy to otherwise briefly and accurately describe Druitt, Kosminski and Ostrog, but it might have been better to have described these men as leading suspects. She includes Kaminsky/Cohen in the assessment of \u201cKosminski\u201d, for once giving full credit to Martin Fido. Ostrog is discounted by Ripperologists, says Anderson, because he was not \u201cthe right type\u201d to have committed the murders, whereas, of course, whilst this may be true, he was also incarcerated in France when the murders took place. The account of Tumblety is likewise not quite right: he\u2019s described as a seller of phony medicines, which is to confuse a purveyor of alternative or herbal medicines with the tub-thumping seller of bogus preparations at county fairs. Other suspects briefly discussed are George Chapman, Prince Albert Victor, Roslyn Donston Stephenson, and, in a box, out, the Maybrick diary. Ms Anderson concludes with a brief survey of the things we can do today which the Victorian police couldn\u2019t, which includes fingerprints, DNA, and psychological and geographical profiling. Jack the Ripper is a tough subject for children and you\u2019ll have to explain what prostitutes and homosexuals are, and maybe what indecency with men is, but overall this book pulls few punches and is a good re-telling of the story, using it to set the context of Victorian society and of modern detection methods.", "identifiers": {"isbn": "ISBN: 978-1-61783-305-2"}, "source": "Microscope", "authors": [{"first_name": "John Gustav", "last_name": "Delly"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/jack-ripper-microscopist", "year": 1988, "type": "journal", "id": "fdec6871-b953-3eb7-ac74-56317c4e5712"}, {"title": "Jack the Ripper and Black Magic: Victorian Conspiracy Theories, Secret Societies and the Supernatural Mystique of the Whitechapel Murders", "abstract": "The figure that terrorized London has become a character in genre fiction and media in crime thrillers, horror, science fiction, and, more recently, urban fantasy, all of which may interest scholars of the fantastic in the arts, particularly since Stephen Knights' more esoteric theories involving the royal family, ritual magic, the occult, and secret societies in Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution (1976) began to influence popular culture.

The signature characteristics observed in these infamous Jack the Ripper murders were compared to a 1981\u20131995 cohort of 3359 homicide cases from Washington State's HITS database. The analysis revealed that the signature displayed in six of the Whitechapel murders was extremely rare. There were only six records of female victims, one a prostitute, with probed, explored, or mutilated body cavities. There were only two cases, both females who were not prostitutes, where the body was left in an unusual position and body cavities were explored, probed, or mutilated.

L. Perry Curtis surveys the mass newspaper culture of the era, delving into the nature of sensationalism and the conventions of domestic murder news. Analyzing the fifteen newspapers - several of which emanated from the East End, where the murders took place - he shows how journalists played on the fears of readers about law and order by dwelling on lethal violence rather than sex, offering gruesome details about knife injuries but often withholding some of the more intimate details of the pelvic mutilations.

In 1909, contemporaries swiftly associated ?the misdeeds of the knifer? with the London Jack the Ripper Case of the year 1888. In spite of the intriguing Ripper tag particular characteristic distinguished the Berlin knifer: the proactive press policy of the Criminal Investigation Department and the cooperation of Berlin?s newspapers. My contention is that the well established semi-official cooperation between Department IV and Berlin?s press was instrumental in ?the making of the case?. The police instigated a public search for the wanted perpetrator, and the success of this undertaking crucially relied on the effective cooperation of the police and the urban population. However, the public investigation of the case was not without frictions and misunderstandings, revealing a rather ambiguous relationship between the authority and the ?subjects?, the inhabitants of Berlin. Furthermore, the daily circulation of clues of the ongoing investigation went with the proliferation of ?the misdeeds of knifer?. Consequently, particularly in this criminal case copycat action was rife, and the suppression of the ?stabbings? was achieved only by extending the ordinary means of the public search coordinated by the police. The examination of this criminal case reveals an essential phase of the urban crime drama in Imperial Berlin, paying particular attention at the interdependent interlacing of the police? public combat of crime, the semi-official media coverage, and the multifaceted and wayward opportunism of the urban population.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84907551985"}, "source": "Crime, History & Societies", "authors": [{"first_name": "P", "last_name": "M\u00fcller"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/covering-crime-restoring-order-berlin-jacktheripper-1909-press-policy-berlin-criminal-investigation", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["Berlin", "History of Crime", "History of Police", "Imperial Germany", "Jack the Ripper", "Media History", "Popular Culture", "Press Policy", "Reception"], "type": "journal", "id": "e9e605ee-a489-3fcc-b2b6-3e92553c1f15"}, {"title": "Three-dimensional computer visualization of forensic pathology data.", "abstract": "Despite a decade of use in US courtrooms, it is only recently that forensic computer animations have become an increasingly important form of communication in legal spheres within the United Kingdom.

Ripper murder have achieve the statuf of a modern myth of male violence against women -- moral: the city is a dangerous place for women, when they transgress the narrow boundaries of home and hearth and dare to enter public space. This article seeks to exorcise this ghost by historicizing Jack the Ripper. Late nineteenth century feminists had desired to liberate women from male sexual tyranny. Josephine Butler has W.T. Stead, editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, expose traffic of English Girls in London \"Maind Tribute of Modern Babylon\" (1885). Passed the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885, raised age of consent for women from 13-16--also made it easier to crak down on prostitution and made homosexuality illegal. Led to massive political initiative against working-class prostitutes, who had been the original objects of feminist pity. Took place in Whitechapel, center for poor JEws escaping pogroms of the 1880s. Also many hopless, poor. Provided a sensational backdrop. Four of the murders took place in the poorest part--even more sensational -- biut inquests showed that real people lived there too. Press described the room and neighborhood in great detail to evoke a sense of place. Mystery compelled by the secrecy of which the murders took place in public spaces and the mystery of the motives, clues and methods. \"Dear Boss\" letters helped to establish the murders as a media event by focusing social anxieties and fantasies on a single, elucisve, alientated figure, who communicated to a \"mass\" public through the newspaper. In sum, the social setting, the mysterious cicurmstances, the grisly mutilations, the ominous figure of Jack the Ripper and the \"deviant\" lives of his victims turned the murders of five poor prostitutes into a national scandal. The Ripper episode covertly sanctioned male antagonism twoard womena nd buttressed male authority over them. The class cries has passed, but sexual fears and hostilities reamin.

The primary emphasis of research into blunt force trauma has focused on analysing the demographics rather than the mechanobiology of such injuries. Nevertheless, a large body of literature has accumulated on the biomechanics of skin. Here we review this evidence, together with the complex role of intrinsic factors such as age, sex and ethnicity on the wounding susceptibility of skin. We also review how the skin responds to blunt trauma, and try to relate this to the estimation of the force of impact. Finally, we review the current biomechanical models of blunt force trauma, and introduce our own model and its preliminary findings. Contrary to the impression gained from the literature, wounding can be modelled in a basic simulation of the contact events during blunt force impact, and the results be evaluated quantitatively. We conclude that subject-specific parameters could be calculated from a more sophisticated model in order to provide a more robust set of values that can be used to predict forces used in generating skin wounds.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-78650718476", "issn": "15565661", "isbn": "978-1-61779-248-9", "doi": "10.1007/978-1-61779-249-6"}, "source": "Forensic Pathology Reviews, Volume 6", "authors": [{"first_name": "Martin H", "last_name": "Villet"}, {"first_name": "Jens", "last_name": "Amendt"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/forensic-pathology-reviews", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["0ost mortem interval s", "eath time estimation s", "nsects", "ntomology s"], "type": "journal", "id": "50b18f6a-274a-377e-8ed3-da37cb07668f"}, {"title": "Primer on Molecular Genetics", "abstract": "This primer was prepared by Denise Casey, Human Genome Management Information System, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, for the 1991-92 DOE Human Genome Program Report.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-77958578317"}, "source": "Human Genome 1991-92 Program Report", "authors": [{"last_name": "DOE Human Genome Program"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/primer-molecular-genetics", "year": 1992, "type": "report", "id": "0c63fddf-7e7e-3e02-b319-8e32964bddf6"}, {"title": "Behavioral Genetics", "abstract": "Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911) was the first scientist to study heredity and human behavior systematically.

This study characterizes the environmental exposures resulting from destruction of the WTC and assesses their effects on health. Methods include ambient air sampling; analyses of outdoor and indoor settled dust; high-altitude imaging and modeling of the atmospheric plume; inhalation studies of WTC dust in mice; and clinical examinations, community surveys, and prospective epidemiologic studies of exposed populations. WTC dust was found to consist predominantly (95%) of coarse particles and contained pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated furans and dioxins. Airborne particulate levels were highest immediately after the attack and declined thereafter. Particulate levels decreased sharply with distance from the WTC. Dust pH was highly alkaline (pH 9.0-11.0). Mice exposed to WTC dust showed only moderate pulmonary inflammation but marked bronchial hyperreactivity. Evaluation of 10,116 firefighters showed exposure-related increases in cough and bronchial hyperreactivity. Evaluation of 183 cleanup workers showed new-onset cough (33%), wheeze (18%), and phlegm production (24%). Increased frequency of new-onset cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath were also observed in community residents. Follow-up of 182 pregnant women who were either inside or near the WTC on 11 September showed a 2-fold increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. In summary, environmental exposures after the WTC disaster were associated with significant adverse effects on health. The high alkalinity of WTC dust produced bronchial hyperreactivity, persistent cough, and increased risk of asthma. Plausible causes of the observed increase in SGA infants include maternal exposures to PAH and particulates. Future risk of mesothelioma may be increased, particularly among workers and volunteers exposed occupationally to asbestos. Continuing follow-up of all exposed populations is required to document the long-term consequences of the disaster.

These devices will take the form of cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDA's), embedded processors, and \"Internet appliances\". This proliferation of networked computing devices will enable a number of compelling applications, centering around ubiquitous access to global information services, just in time delivery of personalized content, and tight synchronization among compute devices/appliances in our everyday environment. However, one of the principal challenges of realizing this vision in the post-PC environment is the need to reduce the energy consumed in using these next-generation mobile and wireless devices, thereby extending the lifetime of the batteries that power them. While the processing power, memory, and network bandwidth of post-PC devices are increasing exponentially, their battery capacity is improving at a more modest pace. Thus, to ensure the utility of post-PC applications, it is important to develop low-level mechanisms and higher-level policies to maximize energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose the systematic re-examination of all aspects of operating system design and implementation from the point of view of energy efficiency rather than the more traditional OS metric of maximizing performance. In [7], we made the case for energy as a first-class OS-managed resource. We emphasized the benefits of higher-level control over energy usage policy and the application/OS interactions required to achieve them. This paper explores the implications that this major shift in focus can have upon the services, policies, mechanisms, and internal structure of the OS itself based on our initial experiences with rethinking system design for energy efficiency. Our ultimate goal is to design an operating system where major components cooperate to explicitly optimize for energy efficiency. A number of research efforts have recently investigated aspects of energy-efficient operating systems (a good overview is available at [16, 20]) and we intend to leverage existing \"best practice\" in our own work where such results exist. However, we are not aware of any systems that systematically revisit system structure with energy in mind. Further, our examination of operating system functionality reveals a number of opportunities that have received little attention in the literature. To illustrate this point, Table 1 presents major operating system functionality, along with possible techniques for improving power consumption characteristics. Several of the techniques are well studied, such as disk spindown policies or adaptively trading content fidelity for power [8]. For example, to reduce power consumption for MPEG playback, the system could adapt to a smaller frame rate and window size, consuming less bandwidth and computation. One of the primary objectives of operating systems is allocating resources among competing tasks, typically for fairness and performance. Adding energy efficiency to the equation raises a number of interesting issues. For example, competing processes/users may be scheduled to receive a fair share of battery resources rather than CPU resources (e.g., an application that makes heavy use of DISK I/O may be given lower priority relative to a compute-bound application when energy resources are low). Similarly, for tasks such as ad hoc routing, local battery resources are often consumed on behalf of remote processes. Fair allocation dictates that one battery is not drained in preference to others. Finally, for the communication subsystem, a number of efforts already investigate adaptively setting the polling rate for wireless networks (trading latency for energy). Our efforts to date have focused on the last four areas highlighted in Table 1. For memory allocation, our work explores how to exploit the ability of memory chips to transition among multiple power states. We also investigate metrics for picking energy-efficient routes in ad hoc networks, energy-efficient placement of distributed computation, and flexible RPC/name binding that accounts for power consumption. These last two points of resource allocation and remote communication highlight an interesting property for energy-aware OS design in the post-PC environment. Many tasks are distributed across multiple machines, potentially running on machines with widely varying CPU, memory, and power source characteristics. Thus, energy-aware OS design must closely cooperate with and track the characteristics of remote computers to balance the often conflicting goals of optimizing for energy and speed. The rest of this paper illustrates our approach with selected examples extracted from our recent efforts toward building an integrated hardware/software infrastructure that incorporates cooperative power management to support mobile and wireless applications. The instances we present in subsequent sections cover the resource management policies and mechanisms necessary to exploit low power modes of various (existing or proposed) hardware components, as well as power-aware communications and the essential role of the wide-area environment. We begin our discussion with the resources of a single machine and then extend it to the distributed context.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84890091327", "pmid": "618953453832143370", "doi": "10.1145/566726.566735", "isbn": "1234567890"}, "source": "Proceedings of the 9th workshop on ACM SIGOPS European workshop beyond the PC new challenges for the operating system", "authors": [{"first_name": "Amin", "last_name": "Vahdat"}, {"first_name": "Alvin", "last_name": "Lebeck"}, {"first_name": "Carla Schlatter", "last_name": "Ellis"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/every-joule-precious-case-revisiting-operating-system-design-energy-efficiency", "year": 2000, "type": "journal", "id": "59871702-396c-3694-a12e-ff52a9714fb7"}, {"title": "Evaluating operating system vulnerability to memory errors", "abstract": "Reliability is of great concern to the scalability of extreme-scale systems. Of particular concern are soft errors in main memory, which are a leading cause of failures on current systems and are predicted to be the leading cause on future systems. While great effort has gone into designing algorithms and applications that can continue to make progress in the presence of these errors without restarting, the most critical software running on a node, the operating system (OS), is currently left relatively unprotected. OS resiliency is of particular importance because, though this software typically represents a small footprint of a compute node's physical memory, recent studies show more memory errors in this region of memory than the remainder of the system. In this paper, we investigate the soft error vulnerability of two operating systems used in current and future high-performance computing systems: Kitten, the lightweight kernel developed at Sandia National Laboratories, and CLE, a high-performance Linux-based operating system developed by Cray. For each of these platforms, we outline major structures and subsystems that are vulnerable to soft errors and describe methods that could be used to reconstruct damaged state. Our results show the Kitten lightweight operating system may be an easier target to harden against memory errors due to its smaller memory footprint, largely deterministic state, and simpler system structure.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84864745100", "doi": "10.1145/2318916.2318930", "isbn": "9781450314602"}, "source": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for Supercomputers - ROSS '12", "authors": [{"first_name": "Kurt B.", "last_name": "Ferreira"}, {"first_name": "Kevin", "last_name": "Pedretti"}, {"first_name": "Ron", "last_name": "Brightwell"}, {"first_name": "Patrick G.", "last_name": "Bridges"}, {"first_name": "David", "last_name": "Fiala"}, {"first_name": "Frank", "last_name": "Mueller"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/evaluating-operating-system-vulnerability-memory-errors", "year": 2012, "keywords": ["dram failures", "fault-tolerance", "operating systems"], "type": "journal", "id": "efb808c1-f798-3605-a28b-210ee7e45d3f"}, {"title": "The Works of John Milton", "abstract": "FA Patterson, The Works of John Milton, (New York: Columbia University Press, 1937) XIII.169ff.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79958538030", "isbn": "1-85326-4510-5"}, "source": "The Wordsworth Poetry Library", "authors": [{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Milton"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/works-john-milton", "year": 1994, "keywords": ["Milton, Poetry"], "type": "book", "id": "c0ed4fbb-8ba4-3116-8aeb-034c857a0a22"}, {"title": "Medical Disaster: Why Ken Mattingly Can\u2019t Have Measles in Apollo 13", "abstract": "The film Apollo 13 depicts denial of illness and refusal of health care as key components of American masculinity.

The Red Bull Stratos Mission Control Center (MCC) evolved over time to serve this function. A medical representative in MCC served the traditional role of providing real-time medical input to the mission director and was supported by a medical back room. This article will describe medical mission control planning and operations for Red Bull Stratos and discuss lessons learned. Methods: The medical mission control team consisted of several physicians and a ventilator engineer in the MCC and medical back room. Video downlinks provided status of the test parachutist and life support systems. GPS coordinates were also displayed in real time for tracking. Communication panels enabled two-way communications between MCC and the back room, while the back room communicated with the field medical teams primarily using text messaging. A number of protocols for nominal and contingency medical operations were developed. Results: The integrated medical mission control team provided MCC with critical information and maintained the field medical teams\u2019 situational awareness. The team was able to address several operational issues in real time. Discussion: A coordinated medical mission control team was invaluable. Lessons learned included the need for careful risk analysis and response planning, pre-coordination, and adaptability.

Further, they consistently raised key questions about the defining features of the genre itself as it continued to evolve: its preferred themes, its social purpose, its scientific and moral didacticism, its perceived level of verisimilitude, and its place in the Western literary canon. Finally, as the new millennium dawns, it seems appropriate that we look to our distant past to rediscover what these early commentators had to say about the many science fictional works of their times: doing so serves to deepen our understanding of the historical continuity of the ongoing sf debate and to make us aware of both how much and how little has changed over the centuries.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79956581959", "issn": "0091-7729", "isbn": "00917729", "doi": "10.2307/4240782"}, "source": "Science Fiction Studies", "authors": [{"first_name": "Arthur B.", "last_name": "Evans"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/origins-science-fiction-criticism-kepler-wells", "year": 1999, "type": "journal", "id": "2a577cd9-a413-3153-a4f0-7026a40cabe4"}, {"title": "The Narrative Craft: realism and fiction in the Arabic canon", "abstract": "What is a novel?

You cannot be a success without being commercial.  You cannot have high literature without low literature because they need each other to define themselves. Generally though, literature is desribed as more creative. Popular fiction is not engaged with the art world, but with commercial entities and industry.  Popular fiction writers are all about production - they maintain their outputs over long periods of time and are the most prolific of writers.  Serialisation secures a loyal readership and consolidates a novelist's reputation. Romance serialisation may be one of the ways either on your own website or on magazines to create your readership.  The long-term successful writer 'has a game plan called craft. He knows that it will be a lot of work, and he is readyand willing to do the work to achieve the outcome he wants.  The author makes the distinction that while high literature emphasises complexity, popular fiction emphasises simplicity.  Popular fiction gives it over to fantasy - while literature is intimately connected to life / art. Literature is restrained while popular fiction is excessive and exaggerated. Literature doesn't need a story or a plot, but popular fiction couldn't function without one - literature is 'dull' while popular fiction is, simply exciting because it has to be. One can simply enjoy both, but on different terms and under different logics.  Popularity:  Although Henry James was a prolific novelist, he earned a meagre income from his work, even though he is considered the father of the modern literary novel.  Rainey writes that Modernism doesn't require a mass of readers, but a core of patron-collectors', much like that of the art world.  The difference between popular fiction and literary fiction is not how popular it is, but in terms of it's intention.  A choice will be made by the writer, does she intend to reach a large number of readers - if so, a particular kind of career will be set in motion. Does she intend to develop a reputation with a close group, and work in isolation for little reward.  The literary writer treats commercial success with disdain, and would feel that commercial success would taint his reputation because popular fiction is affiliated with entertainment. If you don't see yourself as an entertainer, then you are not a popular fiction writer.  Entertainment, product and brand: Holmes, Bond and Potter  By the 1990's names of popular fiction writers functioned as brand names themselves. Big popular fiction writers' careers will often span many mediums with books being turned into TV or movies.  Popular fiction whose characters become bigger or more well known than the authors, becoming iconic themselves will generate obscene amounts of audience loyalty and merchandising royalties.  The characters and stories that become iconic like J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter are superficial in that it is just entertainment, but can be used to re-brand the image of whole countries as happened with Harry Potter and Britain, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy and New Zealand.  Ideologies of reading, reading practices:  What is popular fictions role? Entertainment and a form of industrial production from the perspective of the writer. When a story goes big, it has wide commercial and merchandising potential. Popular fiction is a product, whereas Literature is more complex, disavowing its commercial identity. Readers of popular fiction are consumers while students of literature become readers.  Merchandising provides an ideological distinction between Literature and popular fiction.   Some commentators doubt whether popular fiction can be read seriously like Literature, and whether it can be understood at an intellectual level. There are differences in reading practices between popular fiction and Literature. Readers of popular fiction read faster (consume) it, they are distracted by merchandising, movies, branding etc. The consumer of popular fiction is removed from life, distracted from it as they consume constantly fantasy spaces. Popular fiction manipulates, rather than critically brings the reader closer to life. This does not necessarily mean that popular fiction is consumed 'unthinkingly' but it is not read closely.  Questions for tutor:  Is popular fiction mutually exclusive to literary works ? A writer can write both, they just require differing skill-sets.  Critical comments (not included in word count):  Many of the works of fiction, that are now part of the English canon were thought of as popular fiction by it's contemporaries. Popular is just different, with different motives and skills involved. I think that in the past I felt that the mills and boons books have been not worth reading, but only because they are full of cliches, and I think that popular fiction can be enjoyed without the laziness of cliches.  Meaningful critique: strengths and weaknesses; is it easy to understand? how does it relate to content (about the essay topic) in other readings / resources?   What is the question (or issue) the piece is attempting to answer?  Whether Literature or literary fiction is worthier than popular fiction.  What is the main claim (or claims) about this issue made in the pieces ?  Both forms of writing have different characteristics, require different skills sets, and are written and read with different motives.  Popular fiction is simplistic, and is written and used for entertainment. Commercial interests are valued above artistic attributes.  Literature is complex and weighty. It is written in a dialogue with life. Artistic attributes are valued above commercial interests.  Success will only come with commercial viability.  How well do these claims answer the issue ?  The argument is that these are two differing forms, which should not be viewed in competition with each other, and that they both can interact in the cultural field.  What evidence is offered to support the claim(s) ?  The article used evidence of several well known writers and authors, and several well-known pieces.  What assumptions has the author made ?  I think to a certain extent it assumes that the reader thinks that popular fiction is looked down upon by 'serious' writers.  It does not consider the popular hybrids which can have literary merit. It assumes that writers stay in their areas neatly - I'm not sure that writers today do that. Probably some romance writers do, because that's all they know how to write.  How does this reading relate to the assignment ?   It is again helping me to decide what form I should choose for my draft work, but also where I want to take my career.Who wrote the source ?  Ken Gelder  Who is the source aimed at ?  I assume it is writing students.  How will this source be useful in supporting my argument ?    What is your response to the source ?  I think that this article is putting some perspective, and emphasis on the difference between these two forms without actually lifting one up to be better than another. It's just that one is popular, and one is not.

Planning for nurse staffing on wards is undertaken in every ward in every trust, supported by evidence based tools / methodologies to set core establishments sufficient to maintain safe nurse to patient ratios. 2. Ward sisters (or equivalent) are empowered to make day to day decisions on staffing and resource levels with the authority to act on those decisions. 3. Ward sisters and nurse managers are supported by the Director of Nursing and the Trust Board; the Trust Board must be accountable for staffing levels being maintained at the calibrated safe and appropriate levels. 4. Under no circumstances is it safe to care for patients in need of hospital treatment with a ratio of more than 8 patients per registered nurse during the day time on general acute wards including those specialising in care for older people. 5. If registered nurse staffing falls below a ratio of 1 nurse to 8 patients (excluding the nurse in charge) it is a requirement that this be reported and recorded; there is evidence that risk of harm to patients is substantially increased at these staffing levels. 6. Trusts are required to report the frequency of such incidents publically and to take immediate action to remedy the breach. If breaches occur regularly this must be escalated through the Trust\u2019s Risk Management systems. 7. Registered nurses must at all times be supported by a sufficient number of health care assistants and a senior registered nurse in charge of the ward. Research demonstrates that RN staffing levels on hospital wards affect the ability of staff to deliver care well. Where staffing levels are low, care is compromised. An excessive number of patients per RN is associated with a higher than expected mortality rate and other harms. A ratio of more than 8 patients per RN significantly increases the risk of harm and constitutes a breach in patient safety which should be escalated by RNs for investigation. Staff must be encouraged and supported to inform senior nurses and managers when they regard staffing as unsafe, at whatever level. For the sake of clarity: 1:8 is the level at which care is considered to be unsafe and putting patients at risk; it is not a recommended minimum. For nurses to provide compassionate care which treats patients with dignity and respect, higher levels will be needed and these need to be determined by every health care provider (as described in point 1-3 above). We base this recommendation on multiple sources of evidence including: \u2022 In a well known study in English hospitals, conducted prior to the improvement in staffing seen over the first decade of this century, hospitals with nurse patient ratios less than 1:8 (i.e. more patients than this per RN) experienced a 20% or more increase in the odds of death in surgical patients [1]. \u2022 Analysis of the RN4CAST data for the UK shows that this relationship holds for both general medical and surgical wards after accounting for differences in other staff groups [2]. For example, hospitals with an average 1:8 ratio would expect to see approximately 2% more deaths per year among surgical patients and 1% for medical patients when compared to the best staffed 20% of hospitals. This equates to approximately 20 deaths per year in an average hospital. Lower nurse patient ratios are associated with more \u2018excess\u2019 deaths. \u2022 These sorts of relationships are borne out in many international studies [3] and the effect has been demonstrated when staffing on individual shifts falls below planned levels [4]. \u2022 The odds of registered nurses being unable to complete some necessary care are reduced by 66% in the best staffed wards compared to the worst [5]. \u2022 A ratio of 1 RN to 8 patients identifies the level at which significant harm is more likely to occur. It does not represent a safe staffing level. Mandatory day time minimum staffing levels, where they are set, are calibrated for different settings, and typically range from 1:4 to 1:6 [6]. \u2022 A recent national survey of nurses suggests that the majority of daytime nursing shifts achieve ratios of more than 1:8 (i.e. nurses care for 8 patients or fewer)[2] and the majority of trusts meet this ratio most of the time [7].

Utilizing National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data, a prediction scheme for forecasting September tropical cyclone activity has been developed. Based on hindcasting results from 1950 to 2000, 30%-75% of the variance for most tropical cyclone parameters can be hindcast by the end of July. This hindcast skill improves to 45%-75% by the end of August. Similarly, cross-validated hindcast skill explains from 20% to 65% for most variables by the end of July, improving to 30%-65% by the end of August. Simple least squared linear regression was utilized to calculate hindcast skill, and variables were selected that explained the largest degree of variance when combined with the other predictors in the scheme. These predictors tend to be global in nature and include zonal and meridional wind at 200 and 1000 mb and sea level pressure measurements at various global locations. Many of the predictors are strongly correlated with global modes such as El Nin?o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). Based on this September hurricane prediction scheme, U.S. tropical cyclone landfall probability forecasts can also be issued.

The experiments were designed to illustrate the impact of different types of satellite observations on the NOGAPS TC track forecasts. The satellite observations assimilated in these experiments consisted of feature-track winds from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) total column precipitable water and wind speeds, Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) radiances, and Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) and European Remote Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) scatterometer winds. There were some differences between the results from basin to basin and from year to year, but the combined results for the 2005 and 2006 test periods for the North Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins indicated that the assimilation of the feature-track winds from the geostationary satellites had the most impact, ranging from 7% to 24% improvement in NOGAPS TC track forecasts. This impact was statistically significant at all forecast lengths. The impact of the assimilation of SSM/I precipitable water was consistently positive and statistically significant at all forecast lengths. The improvements resulting from the assimilation of AMSU-A radiances were also consistently positive and significant at most forecast lengths. There were no significant improvements/degradations from the assimilation of the other satellite observation types [e. g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) winds, SSM/I wind speeds, and scatterometer winds].

Included is the generation of forecasts on the monthly-to-seasonal timescales, often excluded in text-books despite this type of forecasting having been undertaken for several years.This is a rapidly developing field, with a lot of variations in practices between different forecasting centres. Thus the authors have tried to be as generic as possible when describing aspects of numerical model design and formulation. Despite the reliance on NWP, the human forecaster still has a big part to play in producing weather forecasts and this is described, along with the issue of forecast verification \u2013 how forecast centres measure their own performance and improve upon it.Advanced undergraduates and postgraduate students will use this book to understand how the theory comes together in the day-to-day applications of weather forecast production.

The development of objective systems for forecasting future movement of hurricanes has received considerable attention in recent years. These studies have boxed the storm for several thousand miles and derived parameters that reflect the strength of the polar westerlies in relation to the tropical easterlies. Meridional and zonal movement is then forecast from the imbalance of these two streams. As hurricanes are basically maritime systems, the lack of upper-air data has been a serious handicap in the development of objective studies. The proper placement of upper-level contours, the position of troughs and ridges are quite subjective and are usually placed by inference to other synoptic phenomena. An objective system that partially overcomes this difficulty utilizes suitable surface-ship observations in the ocean areas. For zonal movement, there are essentially two basic forces. The first emphasizes the westward motion and the counter parameter accentuates the eastward motion. The sea-level chart is used for the former and the counter force is the mean temperature (850 mb\u2013500 mb). The two basic forces are similarly applied to the meridional component of motion.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84904112636", "doi": "10.1016/B978-1-4832-3320-8.50013-3", "isbn": "9781483233208"}, "source": "Weather Forecasting for Aeronautics", "authors": [{"first_name": "JOSEPH J.", "last_name": "GEORGE"}, {"first_name": "R.J.", "last_name": "SHAFER"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/weather-forecasting-aeronautics", "year": 1960, "type": "book", "id": "3a192f94-6380-3005-86c2-ab8022c3fac6"}, {"title": "Weather Analysis and Forecasting", "abstract": "Petterssen, J., 1956: Weather Analysis and Forecasting. 2nd ed.

Using ocean-only historical and sensitivity experiments, the impacts of the four winter weather regimes on horizontal and overturning circulations were investigated. The results suggest that the Atlantic Ridge (AR), negative NAO (NAO\u2212), and positive NAO (NAO+) regimes induce a fast (monthly-to-interannual time scales) adjustment of the gyres via topographic Sverdrup dynamics and of the meridional overturning circulation via anomalous Ekman transport.

It observes that this cultural narrative of the Ripper's crimes developed as a warning for women: if they transgressed the margins of traditional, domestic femininity, they risked incurring the ferocious punishment meted out by the Ripper. Thus the Ripper narrative is one means of controlling potentially subversive female behavior. Drawing on the work of feminist scholars such as Walkowitz and Caputi, this article argues that this cultural narrative persists in contemporary accounts of violent crimes against women. By comparing the original \u201cRipper\u201d newspaper reports with media coverage of the 2006 \u201cIpswich Ripper\u201d crimes, this paper demonstrates the ongoing cultural power of the original \u201cRipper\u201d narrative. The paper concludes that we must interrogate the way we tell stories of violent sexual crimes against women. \u201cRipper\u201d stories may retain their original function as cautionary tales\u2014but feminist intervention can transform the nature of that caution into a reminder for both men and women about the enduring cultural power, and danger, of representation.

The relation of childhood personality to sexual risk taking during adolescence has been largely unexplored. METHODS: Using data collected from participants in the Child Sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (CS-NLSY) when they were 5 or 6 years of age (time 1) and 17 or 18 years of age (time 2), the relation of childhood personality to sexual risk taking during adolescence was investigated. Maternal ratings of childhood personality were used to derive resiliency, undercontrol, and overcontrol prototypical profile scores for a diverse sample of 1219 child participants from the CS-NLSY. At time 2, participants reported whether they failed to use oral contraception or condoms during their last sexual intercourse. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the association of personality to sexual risk taking. RESULTS: Proximity to the overcontrolled personality prototype at time 1 was associated with a decreased likelihood of sexual risk taking. Age, male gender, and childhood cognitive achievement were also significant predictors of sexual risk taking. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that children with personality profiles in which internalizing traits are more prominent are less likely than their peers to engage in sexual risk taking during late adolescence.

A few years ago, a spike in Latino HIV infections - even as infections among whites steadily dropped - called attention to a gap in Latino services, said Bob Bongiovanni, HIV prevention program manager for the state Department of Public Health and Environment. Between 1998-2002, Latinos comprised 23 percent of the 1,200 Colorado HIV cases, an abrupt increase from the 9 percent of 1,414 cases Latinos accounted for from 1985-1989.      Three years ago, the department issued a grant to the Latin American Research and Service Agency to study the cultural barriers to HIV education for Latinos. Ramirez helped with the study, and he found that men attached to a self-image of machismo were reluctant to identify as gay or bisexual and thus did not seek information about safe sex. Family ties and religious beliefs also played a part.      Ramirez studied Latino HIV prevention centers in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and then met with metro Denver focus groups of gay and bisexual Latinos to develop a model tailored to the local community. He said his biggest challenge was finding gay Latino men. So Ramirez staffed the center with Latino mentors who reached people through word-of-mouth and Spanish-language newspapers.      The center opened at 1070 Bannock Street in February with a $138,000 budget.

Their distribution within subcortical nuclei suggests that neurons which project to affected regions of cortex often contain tangles, those which receive fibres from such regions usually contain plaques, and nuclei having reciprocal connections with the cortex commonly contain both plaques and tangles. Nuclei with no cortical connections rarely show significant pathological change. Within the cortex, the major pathological changes centre on regions in the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus.

Unlike the other sensory pathways, the olfactory system is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease, and pathology in parts of the brain related to olfactory pathways may be amongst the earliest changes in the disease. The etiology of Alzheimer's disease has a genetic component, which is accentuated in aging and in Down's syndrome. Such a genetic predisposition might be a defect in immune\u00ab competence, permitting entry of the proposed agent into the brain from the nose.

Unraveling this specificity is the task of neuroanatomy. In this endeavor, neuroanatomists have traditionally exploited an impressive array of tools ranging from the Golgi method to electron microscopy. An ideal method for studying anatomy would label neurons that are interconnected, and, in addition, allow expression of foreign genes in these neurons. Fortuitously, nature has already partially developed such a method in the form of neurotropic viruses, which have evolved to deliver their genetic material between synaptically connected neurons while largely eluding glia and the immune system. While these characteristics make some of these viruses a threat to human health, simple modifications allow them to be used in controlled experimental settings, thus enabling neuroanatomists to trace multi-synaptic connections within and across brain regions. Wild-type neurotropic viruses, such as rabies and alpha-herpes virus, have already contributed greatly to our understanding of brain connectivity, and modern molecular techniques have enabled the construction of recombinant forms of these and other viruses. These newly engineered reagents are particularly useful, as they can target genetically defined populations of neurons, spread only one synapse to either inputs or outputs, and carry instructions by which the targeted neurons can be made to express exogenous proteins, such as calcium sensors or light-sensitive ion channels, that can be used to study neuronal function. In this review, we address these uniquely powerful features of the viruses already in the neuroanatomist's toolbox, as well as the aspects of their biology that currently limit their utility.

Therefore, the field of neurophylogeny that links the morphology of the nervous system to early evolutionary events emerged as a discipline that can be helpful for the inference of phylogenetic relationships as well as for the retracing of central nervous system evolution. So far, comparative neuroanatomical investigations in arthropods and annelids have suggested that certain brain centers are highly conserved during evolution. If structures like the mushroom bodies are indeed ancestral features of the bilaterian brain, we would expect to find similar neuropils in other invertebrate phyla as well. However, so far in depth studies of the detailed neuroanatomy of numerous invertebrate taxa are lacking. The present thesis therefore focuses on adding new comparative immunohistochemical data on the nervous system of the two lophotrochozoan phyla Mollusca and Nemertea. The first part of the thesis presents an extensive survey on the detailed neuroanatomy of the lesser-known branches of the phylum Mollusca: Caudofoveata, Solenogastres, Polyplacophora, and Scaphopoda. By comparing the neuroanatomy of those different taxa it is demonstrated that the presence of two pairs of nerve cords of the medullary type is the main unifying feature of the three non-conchiferan taxa. In other respects, the great diversity of the phylum Mollusca likewise results in a considerable variability of the nervous system. Taking the results of both aplacophoran taxa, the brain as well as the nerve cords of Caudofoveata and Solenogastres are built in a conspicuous different manner. Structures that are similar in the nervous system of Caudofoveata and Solenogastres are as well present in the Polyplacophora. Thus a monophyly of Aplacophora could not be confirmed. Comparing the nervous system of the Caudofoveata, Solenogastres, and Polyplacophora, the caudofoveate brain seems to be most complex among the non-conchiferan taxa because it exclusively shows a division into discrete sections. The neuroanatomical data presented here, are therefore not in accordance with the Adenopoda hypothesis placing Caudofoveata basal within Mollusca. The second part of the present thesis concentrates on the neuroanatomy of one representative of the phylum Nemertea. The nervous system of Lineus viridis basically consists of a well developed brain that reveals no compartmentalized neuropils. Paired medullary cords emanate posteriorly from the ventral lobes of the brain while paired cerebral organs are posteriorly attached to the dorsal lobes of the brain. By presenting a detailed view on the peripheral nervous system as well, this study reveals that nemerteans possess four distinct but interconnected nerve plexus. The results indicate that a subepidermal plexus most likely belongs to the ground pattern of Lophotrochozoa. Higher brain centers like the mushroom bodies that are typical for the arthropod and annelid brain could not been identified neither in the investigated molluscan taxa nor in the nemertean species. However, the nervous system of the investigated caudofoveate, scaphopod, and nemertean species exhibit clusters of cells resembling the globuli cells that characterize the arthropod and annelid mushroom body. Those globuli-like cell clusters are located in the precerebral ganglia of caudofoveates and the cerebral organs of nemerteans, respectively. Like the mushroom bodies of arthropods and annelids the precerebral ganglia as well as the cerebral organs are involved in the processing of olfactory information. Assuming that these cell clusters are indeed homologous, the present findings argue for the existence of mushroom body-like precursor structures in the last common ancestor of all protostomes. Besides the contribution to the evolution of certain brain centers in protostomes, the neuroanatomical data obtained in the present study are used for the construction of a data matrix that will result in a phylogenetic tree that is exclusively based on neuroanatomical data.", "authors": [{"first_name": "Simone", "last_name": "Faller"}], "source": "Neuroanatomy", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/comparative-neuroanatomy-mollusks-nemerteans-context-deep-metazoan-phylogeny", "year": 2012, "keywords": ["anatomy", "mollusca", "nemertean", "neuroanatomy", "q"], "type": "journal", "id": "ee090bf5-cf33-3209-865b-ee1df22e77d4"}, {"title": "The Brain: An Introduction to Functional Neuroanatomy", "abstract": "The authors of the most cited neuroscience publication, The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, have written this introductory textbook for neuroscience students.

One marker for the disease-specific atrophy is the thickness of the cortical mantle across the brain, obtained with automated 3-D image processing. Here, we present data from 36 subjects (17 controls and, 19 patients diagnosed as probable AD) investigated for cortical thickness across the entire brain. We show significant cortical thickness decline in AD in temporal, orbitofrontal and parietal regions, with the most pronounced changes occurring in the allocortical region of the medial temporal lobes, outlining the parahippocampal gyrus, and representing a loss of >1.25 millimeters of cortical thickness. Moreover, focal cortical areas decline with progression of the disease as measured by time from baseline scan as well as the Mini-Mental State Exam. The results demonstrate the ability of this method to detect changes in cortical thickness in AD, across the entire brain, without need of prior anatomical definitions. The regional distribution of changes reported here is consistent with independent findings on the distribution of neuropathological alterations in AD.

Vocalization was associated with increased and highly correlated activity within the midline structures-PAG and paramedian cortices-described in lower mammalian species. Concurrent activation and connectivity of neocortical and subcortical motor regions - medial and lateral premotor structures and elements of basal ganglia thalamocortical circuitry-suggest a mechanism by which this system may have come under an increasing degree of voluntary control in humans. Additionally, areas in the temporal lobe and cerebellum were selectively activated during voiced but not unvoiced speech.

Lancisi in early XVIII century. Early reports of simple hygienic measures, such as quarantine and slaughter, stopping the transmission of infection and eradicating the disease at the local level showed that global eradication should be possible. More difficult to achieve, however, were control and eradication where cattle populations were large and mobile and their owners averse to quarantine and slaughter. To combat rinderpest in these populations, vaccines were developed and immediately seen to offer another weapon in the drive towards eradication. For global eradication, this meant coordination across those regions of the world where the virus was endemic: Eurasia and Africa. The year targeted for achieving eradication was 2010. The global coordination provided by the FAO Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP) orchestrated the efforts and ideas of regional organizations, national veterinary services and individuals alike, assisting them in identifying areas of high disease risk or uncertainty, and focusing improved vaccine delivery and disease surveillance efforts on these often inaccessible areas.<br><br>Considering the impact of rinderpest eradication on food security in many countries, and the current rinderpest epidemiological situation, in line with the GREP deadline of 2010, the Director-General of FAO reviewed the situation on the occasion of World Food Day on 15 October 2010.

First compiled in 2012, the LCDB has been updated in early 2014 to include, among other indicators, the latest test results from: the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS); the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS); the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA); and the initial output from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which looks at cognitive skill levels across the population. The report also draws on desk research, as well as interviews conducted with experts in education.  Although they may not be able to quantify it, governments in most countries recognise a link between the knowledge and skills with which young people enter the workforce and long-term economic competitiveness. This report is aimed at helping policymakers, educators, academics and other specialists to identify some of these factors. Highlights include: strong relationships are few between education inputs and outputs; there is no substitute for good teachers; income matters but culture may matter more; when it comes to school choice, good information is crucial; there is no single path to better labour market outcomes; and the Global Index of Cognitive Skills and Educational Attainment, an output of 'The learning curve' program and covering 40 countries, can help highlight educational strengths and weaknesses.  Five lessons are drawn for education policymakers: (1) there are no easy solutions; education requires long-term, coherent and focused system-wide attention to achieve improvement; (2) respect teachers; (3) culture can be changed; (4) education systems work better when they keep parents informed and work with them; and (5) education for the future, not just the present.", "authors": [{"first_name": "Lessons I N", "last_name": "Country"}, {"first_name": "Performance I N", "last_name": "Education"}], "source": "Lessons in Country Performance in Education", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/learning-curve-18", "year": 2012, "type": "journal", "id": "73a3838c-886e-3318-874b-3649c278f966"}, {"title": "UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME BUREAU FOR CRISIS PREVENTION & RECOVERY The Post-Tsunami Recovery in the Indian Ocean", "abstract": "The Post-Tsunami Recovery in the Indian Ocean: Lessons Learned, Successes, Challenges and Future Action", "authors": [{"first_name": "Lessons", "last_name": "Learned"}, {"first_name": "Future", "last_name": "Action"}], "source": "UNDP", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/united-nations-development-programme-bureau-crisis-prevention-recovery-posttsunami-recovery-indian-o", "year": 2005, "type": "journal", "id": "c654e79c-5c5b-317f-9c4e-4a1d88ab6db9"}, {"title": "Indigenous Knowledge for Disaster Risk Reduction", "abstract": "No single knowledge form can be a panacea for disaster risk reduction, but, as this article shows, indigenous knowledge has the potential for contributing far more than is usually permitted.

By examining the ways in which emotions, and talk about emotions, reinforce cultural norms, it aims to understand the interplay between the emotions and the ethics of the Roman upper classes in the late Republic and early Empire. How (in the Roman view) is virtuous behavior shaped by the emotions? How in particular do various Roman forms of fear, dismay, indignation, and revulsion support or constrain ethically significant behavior? How do the domains of these emotions - what they are \"about\" - intersect, overlap, or complement each other? How does their interaction create an economy of displeasure that aims to shape society in constructive ways? And - since the Romans' language of emotions is not our own - how can we answer any of these questions without imposing upon the Romans our own notions of what a given emotion is?

Although some of the texts discussed are canonical and familiar, the relations among them have not been noticed. There is a well-known genre of mock-heroic poetry which parodies epic. Mock epic differs in being written at a time when serious epic, though still a highly respected genre with many writers and readers, was also in a state of stasis or stagnation, failing to produce any acknowledged masterpiece after <i>Paradise Lost</i> (1667). Epic was often criticized as depending on supernatural machinery and barbarous heroic values that were unsuitable for the modern world. Mock epic therefore both satirizes the epic genre and expands its scope beyond mock heroic to address satirically a wide range of ambitious themes. It includes satire on pedantic scholarship (Pope's <i>Dunciad</i>), anticlerical satire (Voltaire's <i>La Pucelle</i>, Blumauer's travesty of the <i>Aeneid</i>), satire on religion (Parny's <i>La Guerre des dieux</i>), a liberal, but not necessarily libertine, exploration of the relation between the sexes (Wieland's <i>Oberon</i>, Byron's <i>Don Juan</i>), and the relation between Europe and its Oriental 'other' (Wieland and Byron again). Besides mock heroic, it draws on other literary traditions, notably the Italian romance epic (especially Ariosto), but also traditions of parody and travesty, and it foregrounds its relation to prior texts-including earlier mock epics-through an elaborate display of intertextuality. By 1847, when the last text discussed, Heine's <i>Atta Troll</i>, was published, the elements that composed the mock-epic genre were dispersing, but the genre has (as the Epilogue shows) an afterlife in early twentieth-century modernism.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84921555552", "doi": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199571581.001.0001", "isbn": "9780191722356"}, "source": "Mock-Epic Poetry from Pope to Heine", "authors": [{"first_name": "Ritchie", "last_name": "Robertson"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/mockepic-poetry-pope-heine", "year": 2010, "keywords": ["Epic", "Intertextuality", "Mock Epic", "Mock Heroic", "Parody", "Romance Epic", "Travesty"], "type": "book", "id": "2af47a60-3eaf-32cc-9b2e-ed4bc0409dcd"}, {"title": "Byzantium between East and West and the Origins of Heraldry", "abstract": "This chapter considers the origins and spread of heraldry as a concept. It explores the way in which the western language of complex visual symbols evolved in an environment of the crusades, and has been seen as a response to identifying people in armour, which then became even more complex. Bob then considers the use of a range of images, including the so-called 'Beta cross', the double-headed eagle, the game-board patterns and the Palaiologan and other monograms, and their combinations on monograms, in order to consider whether these can be considered 'heralidic' in the western sense of having a close association with familial identity and distinctiveness. The conclusion of looking at various monuments and tomb carvings is that these images were mainly about power. Insofar as they have any specific meaning it is associated with place or the general idea of the empire. It is monograms, and thus words, which provide specific information about the people. There is also evidence that westerners persistently misunderstood these symbols as heraldic, and thus that by the fifteenth century even Byzantine writers could begin to see them in these terms. Finally, Bob considers the issue of imagery in the Muslim world, and how any of these images, like double-headed eagles overlap. The conclusion is that this is a world of shared and developing shared visual imagery, across all three cultures, in which heraldry an be seen as a specific westerne expression of a much more general phenomenon, in which power is brokered as broadly as possible. Very interesting examples, in which coins come up but very little is done with these in terms of what might be specific about their particular imagery. The stuff on architecture and monuments is red hot though, and as with all of Bob's stuff, it is all very readable and clear.

Not until both royalism and Jacobinism had severe setbacks, and an increased use of military repression had crippled organized resistance, could republican legislators create a stable balance between exceptional measures and the rule of law. Special Tribunals impinged on due process, gave the army a significant role in the civilian apparatus of justice, and raised the amount of penal repression.

Education, once considered the privilege of only the rich and elite, changed with respect to the philosophy of who should be educated. First, the growth of national citizenship meant changes in how people were viewed. Freedom and equality became tenets of Western society and people became citizens who deserved, by birth, a sense of equality under the law. Furthermore, in a pragmatic way, as the Industrial Revolution came to rule society's economic life, greater numbers of workers were needed to produce goods in large quantities. These workers required at least some education and skills; and, the industrial activities of the day seemed to transfer easily into the educational milieu. It became quite possible to teach groups of students academic skills at the same time in the same classroom, instead of teaching them individually. This spelled the beginning of \" mass education. \" Generations of students have experienced this mass education for more than two centuries, and the system has worked to become more standardized, efficient and practical. Asking teachers to teach everyone in similar ways seemed democratic, and the method of mass education reduced costs, time and energy\u2014all important values in an era of industry. Prior to mass education, students were mostly instructed as individuals\u2014usually a single teacher worked with one student or small numbers of students. Today, there is again a move toward a more student-centred learning, often referred to as the personalization of learning. Personalized learning is a method of instruction in which content (sometimes including instructional technology) and the pace of learning are based upon the abilities and interests of each individual learner. This instructional pattern is an antithesis to mass instruction where content, materials and the pace of learning are standardized for all students in a classroom or a course of study. What follows are various viewpoints related to student-centred/personalized learning. Darling-Hammond (1996) argues that the industrial model of education was conceived as an alternative to small elite schools but has not allowed education to fully develop a democratic citizenry. In fact, the model has alienated students from their own learning due to a complexity of factors within the system's design. Darling-Hammond believes professionalism in teaching is a key leverage point to make the changes needed to better prepare students for democratic life.", "authors": [{"first_name": "French", "last_name": "Revolution"}], "source": "From Knowledge to Action", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/chapter-8-studentcentredpersonalized-learning", "year": 2012, "type": "book_section", "id": "9c60c06a-6b1b-3012-baf4-9d19782b3c8a"}, {"title": "'Incorruptible Milk': Breast Feeding and the French Revolution", "abstract": "This interdisciplinary collection of essays examines many facets of the important and paradoxical relation between women and the French Revolution.

The interplay between painting and heraldry in this play insistently suggests the ideological urgency of the question of images in the early modern period. This dialog is the sign of a deep-seated tension between word and image prompted by the anti-image stance of the Reformation. The policies of the crown are rehearsed in the back-and-forth oscillation between painting and heraldry. In the text, royal arms compete with images the way they did on the walls of churches, where frescoes were removed and replaced by the sovereign's arms. These rhetorical moments testify to a sophisticated reflexive awareness of the existence of a dynamic field, in-between word and image, the site of multiple, competing, and eventually undecidable strategies.Accession Number: 505431651; Authors: Vanrigh, Anny Crunelle; Physical Description:Bibliographic footnotes; Illustration; Subject: Heraldry in art; Subject: Art \u2013 15th century; Subject: Illumination of books {&} manuscripts, European; Subject: Medieval iconography; Subject: Edward III (Play); Number of Pages: 17p; Record Type: Article", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-77950704291", "doi": "10.1080/02666280802426089", "issn": "02666286"}, "source": "Word {&} Image Word {&} Image Word {&} Image", "authors": [{"first_name": "Anny Crunelle", "last_name": "Vanrigh"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/illuminations-heraldry-%C3%A4%C3%BAking-edward-iii%C3%A4%C3%B9", "year": 2009, "keywords": ["Softcopy"], "type": "journal", "id": "ebbea7a0-28eb-32e0-9ca1-3dd3b4ceab22"}, {"title": "Heraldry in Medieval Ireland I: Prolegomena", "abstract": " The introduction of heraldic shield-devices to Ireland was a consequence of the Norman invasion.

The question of English women writing epic poetry has never been seriously treated before, at least in part because of the assumption that women were incapable of writing in this genre, or that the English culture of the eighteenth century itself rejected epic poetry. Using a critical framework resting on a feminist 'slant' to New Historicism and Early Modern epic discourse, I show that these attitudes ignore the evidence that eighteenth-century women poets created epic poetry. By examining poems by fourteen women writing between the 1650s and the 1780s, which exhibit epic conventions, themes, and structures, I demonstrate how these poems fashion a less restrictive definition of epic poetry that reflects the rich and vaned literary culture of the period and helps explain the 'sudden' re-emergence of epic poetry in the Romantic Age.                 In Part I, I examine the biblically-inspired epics of Anna Trapnel, Anne Wharton, Amey Heyward, Elizabeth Singer Rowe, Elizabeth Smith, Mary Scott, and Elizabeth Hands who use biblical epics as a way to explore their current political, social, and religious situations. They use epic poetry to challenge the confining roles available to women in the English society of their times. In Part II, I explore the secular epic poems of Margaret Cavendish, Anne Killigrew, Aphra Behn, Elizabeth Thomas, Hannah Cowley, Hannah More, and Anna Seward, as they attempt to \"rescue\" English epic poetry from the constraints of Christianity. These poems explore interactions between the sexes, ideas of citizenship and duty, and humanity's place within the natural world.                 While these epics do not necessarily follow the nineteenth- and twentieth-century definition of epic poetry, they partake of the epic spirit announced by early modern literary critics such as Torquato Tasso, Henry Pemberton, John Dryden, and Anne Dacier.

Activities in the workbook provide up to 37 AMA PRA Category 1 credits. Included in this workbook are a Self-Assessment ABPN approved for Part 2 of MOC), consisting of 50 multiple-choice questions on major depressive disorder, and a Performance in Practice Clinical Module (ABPN approved for Part 4 of MOC). Forms for Feedback Modules (Peer and Patient-Part 4 of MOC) are also provided. Resources for use in an improvement plan-a \"Real-Time Assessment Tool for Patients with Major Depressive Disorder,\" as well as the executive summary from the APA \"Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder, 3rd Edition\" and reprints of recent influential publications on depression, selected by experts- are included. Work is done both in the workbook and online in order to complete documentation of MOC activities and record CME credits in the physician's own CME transcript on the APA website/Learning Management System. The goal of MOC is to improve patient care by assuring that psychiatrists keep up with advances in clinical practice. We have gathered in this workbook practical and evidence-based materials to help psychiatrists develop a sound foundation of medical knowledge and clinical recommendations to keep up-to-date.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2010-05121-010[/rid].) Objective: The authors sought to determine by meta-analysis the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive atypical antipsychotic agents in major depressive disorder. Method: Searches were conducted of MEDLlNE/PubMed (1966 to January 2009), the Cochrane database, abstracts of major psychiatric meetings since 2000, and online trial registries. Manufacturers of atypical antipsychotic agents without online registries were contacted. Trials selected were acute-phase, parallel-group, double-blind controlled trials with random assignment to adjunctive atypical antipsychotic or placebo. Patients had nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder that was resistant to prior antidepressant treatment. Response, remission, and discontinuation rates were either reported or obtained. Data were extracted by one author and checked by the second. Data included study design, number of patients, patient characteristics, methods of establishing treatment resistance, drug doses, duration of the adjunctive trial, depression scale used, response and remission rates, and discontinuation rates for any reason or for adverse events. Results: Sixteen trials with 3,480 patients were pooled using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Adjunctive atypical antipsychotics were significantly more effective than placebo (response: odds ratio = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.46-1.95, z = 7.00, N = 16, p < 0.00001; remission: odds ratio = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.69-2.37, z = 8.03, N = 16, p < 0.00001). Mean odds ratios did not differ among the atypical agents and were not affected by trial duration or method of establishing treatment resistance. Discontinuation rates for adverse events were higher for atypical agents than for placebo (odds ratio = 3.91, 95% CI = 2.68-5.72, z = 7.05, N = 15, p < 0.00001). Conclusions: Atypical antipsychotics are effective augmentation agents in major depressive disorder but are associated with an increased risk of discontinuation due to adverse events.

Existing augmentation or combination strategies can have substantial safety concerns that may limit their application. Method: This study investigated the antidepressant efficacy of a flexible dose of the dopamine agonist pramipexole as an adjunct to standard antidepressant treatment in an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in a tertiary-level depression center. We randomized 60 outpatients (aged 18 to 75 years) with treatment-resistant nonpsychotic MDD (diagnosed according to DSM-IV) to either pramipexole (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30). Treatment resistance was defined as continued depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score = 18) despite treatment with at least 1 prior antidepressant in the current depressive episode. Patients were recruited between September 2005 and April 2008. The primary outcome measure was the MADRS score. Results: The analyses that used a mixed-effects linear regression model indicated a modest but statistically significant benefit for pramipexole (P = .038). The last-observation-carried-forward analyses indicated that 40% and 33% of patients randomized to augmentation with pramipexole achieved response (chi(2) = 1.2, P = .27) and remission (chi(2) = 0.74, P = .61), respectively, compared to 27% and 23% with placebo; however, those differences were not statistically significant. Augmentation with pramipexole was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse effects identified. Conclusion: For patients who have failed to respond to standard antidepressant therapies, pramipexole is a safe and potentially efficacious augmentation strategy.

In the MDD-bipolar cross-disorder analysis, 15 SNPs exceeded genome-wide significance (P<5 \u00d7 10(-8)), and all were in a 248\u2009kb interval of high LD on 3p21.1 (chr3:52\u2009425\u2009083-53\u2009822\u2009102, minimum P=5.9 \u00d7 10(-9) at rs2535629). Although this is the largest genome-wide analysis of MDD yet conducted, its high prevalence means that the sample is still underpowered to detect genetic effects typical for complex traits. Therefore, we were unable to identify robust and replicable findings. We discuss what this means for genetic research for MDD. The 3p21.1 MDD-BIP finding should be interpreted with caution as the most significant SNP did not replicate in MDD samples, and genotyping in independent samples will be needed to resolve its status.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 3 April 2012; doi:10.1038/mp.2012.21.", "identifiers": {"pmid": "22472876", "issn": "1359-4184", "isbn": "1476-5578 (Electronic)\\r1359-4184 (Linking)", "doi": "10.1038/mp.2012.21"}, "source": "Molecular Psychiatry", "authors": [{"first_name": "Major", "last_name": "Depressive"}, {"first_name": "Disorder", "last_name": "Working"}, {"first_name": "Gwas", "last_name": "Consortium"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/megaanalysis-genomewide-association-studies-major-depressive-disorder-24", "year": 2012, "keywords": ["genetics", "genome-wide association study", "major depressive disorder", "mega-analysis"], "type": "journal", "id": "8c18b093-c796-30a5-8644-7beb3db43608"}, {"title": "Constitutional Implications of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011", "abstract": "The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 arose from a specific political circumstance: the need to cement the Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition formed after the May 2010 General Election, but it had a far wider significance.

Since the United Kingdom has limited postwar experience of this outcome, it is natural that commentators have begun to look elsewhere for lessons on the practicalities of minority and coalition government. This article considers the lessons we can learn from the Scottish parliamentary experience since 1999. It outlines two main points of comparison: strength and stability. One might assume that coalition provides more of both than minority government. Indeed, for that reason, it is rare for central or devolved governments in the United Kingdom to operate as minorities through choice. Yet, the Scottish experience shows that the differences between coalition and minority government are not completely straightforward. Much depends on the institutional context and, in many cases, idiosyncratic elements of particular systems. Consequently, one can identify a trade-off in comparative analysis: as the identification of elements specific to one system increases, the ability to draw clear meaningful lessons decreases.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-79959255891", "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-923X.2011.02184.x", "issn": "00323179"}, "source": "Political Quarterly", "authors": [{"first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Cairney"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/coalition-minority-government-scotland-lessons-united-kingdom", "year": 2011, "keywords": ["Britain", "Coalition government", "Devolution", "Minority government", "Scotland"], "type": "journal", "id": "09a73178-253e-3f25-adb7-7f7d0844bdd7"}, {"title": "Democratic Drift: Majoritarian Modification and Democratic Anomie in the United Kingdom", "abstract": "Although there is no doubt that the constitution has been significantly reformed since the election of New Labour in 1997 the degree to which these reforms have altered the nature of democracy in the United Kingdom remains highly contested. A major problem within this debate is that it has become polarised around a binary distinction between power-sharing and power-hoarding models of democracy when the contemporary situation is actually far more complex. This book draws upon theories and methods from comparative political analysis in order to argue and then demonstrate three central and inter-related arguments. Firstly, that the distinctive element of New Labour's approach to constitutional engineering is not that it has shifted the nature of democracy in the United Kingdom from one model to another but has instead sought to apply different models at the periphery and core: bi-constitutionality. Secondly, that contemporary evidence of both increasing levels of public disengagement from conventional politics and falling levels of public trust in politicians, political institutions and political processes originate from the 'expectations gap'. This 'gap' is created by the process of political competition artificially increases public expectations; only for these expectations to be dashed as the elected party either seeks to renege upon certain pre-election commitments or fails to achieve them. Finally, democracy in the United Kingdom is currently drifting. The old rules do not appear to suit the new game, and yet the government continues to insist that the old rules still apply. The critical challenge for any future government, of any political complexion, will be to articulate a new form of constitutional morality with the capacity to clarify exactly what its reforms in the sphere of constitutional reform and democratic renewal are seeking to achieve. The analysis offered in this book focuses on the evolution of democracy in the United Kingdom since the election of New Labour in 1997. However in order to achieve both depth and breadth this analysis is then located within the contours of much broader longitudinal and comparative analyses. This involves examining the trajectory of democracy in the United Kingdom from 1945 onwards, and then comparing this long-term view within a much broader comparative perspective to examine the degree to which recent developments in the United Kingdom fit within global democratic trends.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-84922522883", "doi": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199271597.001.0001", "isbn": "9780191709234", "issn": "1746-918X"}, "source": "Democratic Drift: Majoritarian Modification and Democratic Anomie in the United Kingdom", "authors": [{"first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Flinders"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/democratic-drift-majoritarian-modification-democratic-anomie-united-kingdom", "year": 2009, "keywords": ["'Blair paradox'", "Bi-constitutionality", "Comparative politics", "Constitutional anomie", "Constitutional morality", "Constitutional reform", "Democratic drift", "Democratic renewal", "Lijphart", "Majoritarian modification", "Politics of public expectations", "Westminster model"], "type": "book", "id": "04f819ba-6579-3a55-acc6-631e3cfb56b1"}, {"title": "Coalition and Minority Government in Wales: Lessons for the United Kingdom?", "abstract": "Post-devolution Wales has had experience of a variety of different types of government and a variety of different parties in government; single party rule with one party gaining an overall majority of the seats (Labour, 2003\u201305), minority administrations (Labour, 1999\u20132000, 2005\u201307) and coalitions between Labour and the Liberal Democrats (2000\u201303) and Labour and Plaid Cymru (2007 to date).

High-fidelity simulation of an engine and control system helps to shorten controller development time with reduced risk. This requires the integration of a detailed engine model with a representative controller model.This paper describes the development and validation of an integrated engine and controller model of a turbocharged diesel engine. The integrated model incorporates a detailed engine model in GT-Power and a comprehensive controller model in Simulink with functionalities like the production ECM. The focus of this study is a non-real time simulation and analysis of the control of EGR, turbocharger, and fueling with engine performance.The integrated engine and controller model was extensively validated against vehicle testing data collected on a chassis dynamometer. The accuracy of the integrated model was verified using experimental measurements over five steady state conditions, three step transient conditions, and a full FTP driving cycle. It is shown that the integrated model predicted the performance of the control and engine system (such as fueling/VNT/EGR control actions, MAF, MAP, exhaust gas pressure and temperature, intake and exhaust oxygen fractions, and turbocharger shaft rotational speed) fairly well, both at steady state and at transient operating conditions.The validated engine and controller model will be useful in the analysis and evaluation of control algorithms and control strategies.

To maximise the benefit of modelling for management actions in catchments, researchers, software developers model users and those commissioning modelling should have an understanding of basic modelling principles and the relationship between model complexity, the data available for model development and testing, and predictive performance. Model choice should be made using a horses for courses approach. There is no particular style of model that is inherently better for all applications than another. The general maxim is to choose the simplest model that will do the job required. Adding complexity can lead to reductions in predictive performance unless testing data are available. On practical model applications, it is critical that the context for and objectives of the modelling exercise are clear. There is a model choice decision loop to assist in choosing the right model for a particular purpose. It involves defining the objectives, assessing the availability of data, expertise, and resources and then reassessing whether the objectives can be met. Model users need to be realistic about the role of models in decision making A perfect answer a year late is useless. A model which is too simple or uncertain or inflexible to deal with the real objective/s is useless. Modelling is as much art as science, and the quality of the modeller is at least as important as the quality of the model. From a technical perspective Modellers must understand the principles on which the model is based. Model time and space scales must match objectives and available data.

Through the advancement of theoretical approaches and scientific methodologies, archaeologists have been able to investigate how some of these monuments provide resources to negotiate memories, identities, and power and social relations throughout European history. The essays in this collection examine the life-histories of carefully chosen megalithic monuments, stelae and statue-menhirs, and rock art sites of various European and Mediterranean regions during the Iron Age and Roman and Medieval times. By focusing on the concrete interaction between people, monuments, and places, the volume offers an innovative outlook on a variety of debated issues. Prominent among these is the role of ancient remains in the creation, institutionalization, contestation, and negotiation of social identities and memories, as well as their relationship with political economy in early historic European societies. By contributing to current theoretical debates on materiality, landscape, and place-making, The Lives of Prehistoric Monuments in Iron Age, Roman, and Medieval Europe seeks to overcome disciplinary boundaries between prehistory and history, and highlight the long-term, genealogical nature of our engagement with the world.

The results show that while faunal values have little diachronic variation, the human data vary through time, and there are wide ranges of values within each period.

In this chapter, we start with notation for specifying real-time tasks, and introduce three software architectures widely used in real-time embedded systems. The first software architecture is based on the well-known round-robin principle, where a system is composed of a series of \u201cdetect-acknowledge-service\u201d patterns one for each device of interest. The round-robin architecture suffers from low hardware concurrency because the outstanding period of a service request can be as long as one round of execution in the worst case. The second software architecture is called round robin with interrupts, which brings the interrupt concept into play. Although it can significantly improve hardware concurrency, because of the round-robin nature, it still takes one round of execution time to complete a service request in the worst case. The round-robin architecture with interrupts is then refactored into a queue-based architecture, which allows us to further consider queues with various ordering policies. In particular, we study one architecture based on a {FIFO} queue and one based on a priority queue. The architecture based on a priority queue brings us one step closer to real-time operating systems\u2014the most powerful yet expensive architecture for real-time embedded systems.

Understanding the origin and evolution of stellar angular momentum is one of the major challenges of stellar physics. Aims: We present new models for the rotational evolution of solar-like stars between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with the aim of reproducing the distributions of rotational periods observed for star forming regions and young open clusters within this age range. Methods: The models include a new wind braking law based on recent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo and mass-loss prescriptions are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular velocity. The models additionally assume constant angular velocity during the disk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative core and the convective envelope as soon as the former develops. Results: We have developed rotational evolution models for slow, median, and fast rotators with initial periods of 10, 7, and 1.4 d, respectively. The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behavior of solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 4.5 Gyr, including pre-main sequence (PMS) to zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) spin up, prompt ZAMS spin down, and the early-main sequence (MS) convergence of surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting for the slow and median rotators are very similar to each other, with a disk lifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale of 28-30 Myr. In contrast, fast rotators have both shorter disk lifetimes (2.5 Myr) and core-envelope coupling timescales (12 Myr). We show that a large amount of angular momentum is hidden in the radiative core for as long as 1 Gyr in these models and we discuss the implications for internal differential rotation and lithium depletion. We emphasize that these results are highly dependent on the adopted braking law. We also report a tentative correlation between the initial rotational period and disk lifetime, which suggests that protostellar spin down by massive disks in the embedded phase is at the origin of the initial dispersion of rotation rates in young stars. Conclusions: We conclude that this class of semi-empirical models successfully grasp the main trends of the rotational behavior of solar-type stars as they evolve and make specific predictions that may serve as a guide for further development.

By minimizing the total mechanical energy of a given system under the constraint of stellar angular momentum loss, we rigorously find the conditions for the existence of dynamical equilibrium states.

We introduce dimensionless variables to characterize the tidal evolution of observed hot Jupiter systems and discuss their spin and orbital states using generalized Darwin diagrams based on our new approach. We show that their orbital properties are related to the effective temperature of their host stars. The long-term evolution of planets orbiting F- and G-type stars is significantly different owing to the combined effect of magnetic braking and tidal dissipation. The existence of a quasi-stationary state, in the case of short-period planets, can significantly delay their tidal evolution that would otherwise bring the planet to fall into its host star. Most of the planets known to orbit F-type stars are presently found to be near this stationary state, probably in a configuration not too far from that they had when their host star settled on the zero-age main sequence.

The ancient rocks differ strikingly in individual and collective composition, occurrence, association, and structure from modern rocks. Widespread forcing of Archean geology into plate-tectonic frameworks reflects unwarranted faith in uniformitarianism and in inappropriate chemical discriminants, and disregard for the lack of features that characterize plate interactions. Archean crust records extreme and prolonged internal mobility and was far too weak and mobile to behave as rigid plates, required, by definition, for plate tectonics. None of the geologic indicators of subduction, arc magmatism, and continental sundering, separation, and convergence have been documented. No Archean oceanic crust or mantle has been recognized, and the only known basement to supra-crustal rocks, including the thick basalts, high-Mg basalts, and ultramafic lavas that typify greenstone successions, consists of tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) migmatites and gneisses. A thick global melabasaltic protocrust likely formed by ca. 4.45 Ga, and from it TTG suites were extracted by partial melting over the next 2 b.y. Delamination of the increasingly dense restitic protocrust enabled rise of lighter and hotter depleted mantle and hence more melting. The oldest known crustal materials are zircons, which scatter in age back to 4.4 Ga and are recycled in migmatites whose final crystallization was after 3.8 Ga, and in ancient sediments. Earth may have had a dense greenhouse atmosphere, not a hydrosphere, before 3.6 Ga, for the oldest proved supracrustal rocks are of that age, and older felsic crust may have been too hot to permit rise of dense melts. Rigid plates of lithosphere did not stabilize until a billion years after that and then were mostly small and local.Dense lavas erupted atop mobile felsic crust after 3.6 Ga produced a density inversion that was partly righted by sinking of the volcanic rocks and rising of the subjacent TTG. In some places, the early dense rocks retained cohesion and sank as synclinal keels between rising domiform diapiric batholiths. In others, the early dense rocks sank deep into mobile TTG crust, and only later in Archean time was the felsic substrate strong enough to enable dome-and-keel style. The TTG substrate rose slowly, with variable amounts of partial melting to generate more-fractionated melts and with additions of new TTG from the underlying protocrust, for hundreds of millions of years. The mantle beneath preserved cratons generated ultramafic melts that required a temperature \u223c300\u00b0C hotter than modern asthenosphere ca. 3.5 Ga. Severe and prolonged lateral deformation was superimposed on large parts of some cratons during the era of volcanism and diapirism, obscuring dome-and-keel geology over broad tracts. Lower crust was at high temperature for prolonged periods and flowed pervasively, coupled discontinuously to the upper crust to produce lateral deformation therein.Rifting, separation, rotation, and collision of internally more rigid lithosphere fragments began ca. 2.1 Ga, but may have been dominantly intracontinental deformation, quite distinct from modern plate tectonics. The products of this regime differ greatly from those of Phanerozoic plate tectonics, and reflect a transitional era of erratically stiffening lithosphere. An early-depleted upper mantle has been progressively re-enriched, by delamination and subduction of crustal materials, while new \u201cjuvenile\u201d crust derived from it has become progressively more depleted, during Pro-terozoic and Phanerozoic time.

Its chemical and isotopic compositions provide an integrated view of this accretion and early differentiation history. Geochemical data for the Earth and other terrestrial planets can be compared with the results of experimental simulations, theory, and astronomical observations to elucidate the conditions of planet and core formation. This chapter summarizes the latest thinking in this area and particularly focuses on the portion that we think is best understood, the state of the Earth at around the time of the last major stage of accretion, the Moon-forming Giant Impact. The age of the Moon is known to lie in the range 30-55My after the start of the solar system because of evidence of decay of formerly live 182Hf (half-life=8.9My) to 182W within the lunar interior. As such, Earth's accretion and differentiation was more protracted than that of Mars, Vesta, and magmatic iron meteorite parent bodies for which W and other isotope data provide evidence of internal differentiation certainly within 5My and probably <1My. There is no evidence that the Earth grew at a slower rate when it was of an equivalent size, merely that significant accretion persisted for longer. The Earth formed from material that was on average depleted in moderately volatile elements such as potassium relative to the concentrations found in the Sun. Isotopic data provide evidence that some of this loss took place during the growth of the Earth and/or its constituent accreting protoplanets. Noble gas isotopic compositions have been used to argue for a component of solar nebular volatiles in the Earth's interior, a major fraction of which was probably lost during accretion. However, it is also possible that at certain times the early Earth was associated with a blanketing atmosphere such that the energy from accretion led to magma oceans. The abundances of siderophile elements in the Earth's mantle provide evidence that some of the core formed from metal that segregated at high pressures and temperatures possibly in such an environment. Tungsten isotopes also indicate that the majority of the siderophile-element budget that was added to the Earth during its accretion isotopically equilibrated with the silicate reservoir before being segregated into the core, which is consistent with magma oceans. The small difference between the W isotopic compositon of the silicate Earth and chondrites could reflect efficient mixing and decay over the period of accretion. However, it may also partly reflect disequilibrium such as when large fragments of planetary core material mixed directly with the Earth's core. The age of the Moon provides an independent evaluation of which explanation is correct but the uncertainty is still too large to offer very strong constraints. Experimental petrology provides evidence that the core equilibrated in stages at various pressures and temperatures during accretion of the Earth. As it did so the phases present in the mantle would have changed. The oxidation state of the mantle is thought to have evolved as a result although it is also possible that there was an evolution in the composition of accreted material. Perovskite crystallization in particular may have changed the oxidation state of the silicate Earth. Mars and Vesta differentiated at lower pressures and therefore did not undergo this self-oxidation. Even though their cores are smaller and the Fe content of their mantles is higher, the magmas are less oxidized than those of the Earth.Recently, new stable isotope tracers of accretion and core formation have been developed. It has been found that there are no significant differences between the lithium and magnesium isotopic compositions of 'normal' mantle-derived materials from the Earth, Moon, Mars, and Vesta. As such, there is no evidence for significant evaporative losses during the accretion processes that built the Earth and Moon. However, the iron isotopic compositions of terrestrial and lunar basalts are slightly heavy for reasons that are unclear. One possiblility is that the high-pressure perovskite-driven self-oxidation process led to enrichment in isotopically heavy iron in the silicate Earth and light iron in the core. The similar composition of the Moon would then be hard to explain unless there was some level of isotopic mixing and equilibration between the Earth and the proto-lunar disk as recently proposed to explain the identical oxygen isotopic compositions.Lead and thallium isotopes provide evidence for losses from the silicate Earth postdating the Giant Impact by tens of millions of years. These may be caused by a late stage loss of sulfide from the mantle following the addition of large amounts of sulfur from the impactor's core. Being relatively volatile however, these elements might also have been atmophile and lost from protoatmospheres as recorded in xenon isotopes. This history of accretion and differerntiation links up with evidence from 146Sm-142Nd studies that the Hadean mantle was differentiated at an early stage. However, recent proposals that the deep mantle contains hidden primordial reservoirs left over from this period need to be treated with some caution because the degree to which the Earth is exactly chondritic in its Sm-Nd systematics is unclear. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This age is significantly later than had been deduced from W isotopes based on model assumptions or isotopic effects now known to be cosmogenic. The Sr age is in excellent agreement with earlier estimates based on the time of lunar Pb loss and the age of the early lunar crust (4.46+/-0.04Ga). Similar ages for the BSE are recorded by xenon and lead-lead, providing evidence of catastrophic terrestrial degassing, atmospheric blow-off and significant late core formation accompanying the ca 100Ma giant impact. Agreement between the age of the Moon based on the Earth's Rb/Sr and the lead-lead age of the Moon is consistent with no major losses of moderately volatile elements from the Earth during the giant impact. The W isotopic composition of the BSE can be explained by end member models of (i) gradual accretion with a mean life of roughly 35Ma or (ii) rapid growth with a mean life of roughly 10Ma, followed by a significant hiatus prior to the giant impact. The former assumes that approximately 60 per cent of the incoming metal from impactors is added directly to the core during accretion. The latter includes complete mixing of all the impactor material into the BSE during accretion. The identical W isotopic composition of the Moon and the BSE limits the amount of material that can be added as a late veneer to the Earth after the giant impact to less than 0.3+/-0.3 per cent of ordinary chondrite or less than 0.5+/-0.6 per cent CI carbonaceous chondrite based on their known W isotopic compositions.

In this paper we have run 41 simulations of the planetary collisions; these constitute an exploration of some of the relevant parameter space. The parameters varied include the mass ratio of the Impactor to the Protoearth (values of 0.14, 0.16, and 0.25), the angular momentum in the collision (in units of the present angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, from slightly more than 1 to slightly less than 2), and the velocity at infinity (0, 5, and 7 km/sec). For a mass ratio of 0.14, there is only a rather narrow range of conditions in which an iron-free disk can be obtained. For higher mass ratios the range of conditions is much wider. For lower values of the angular momentum, the Impactor is destroyed in the collision and drawn out into a long arc. The inner part of this falls into the Protoearth, usually including all the iron, leaving the outer part of the arc in orbit. For higher values of the angular momentum the Impactor is not completely destroyed on impact, but it draws itself together as it travels beyond the Roche lobe and comes around for a second collision, whereupon the results are essentially as described above, except that the disks can contain more material. Occasionally a body of substantial size (a major fraction of or comparable to the mass of the Moon) is formed and left in a stable orbit beyond the Roche lobe. This presents us with two possible scenarios for the formation of the Moon: either directly in the collision or after dissipation and evolution of the disk. These collisions do very extensive damage to the Protoearth. The iron core of the Impactor plunges through the mantle of the Protoearth and forms a very hot layer (several tens of thousands of degrees) around the surface of the Protoearth core; this will later provide a heat source to drive vigorous mantle convection. The outer part of the mantle of the Protoearth is also strongly heated, with rock decomposition products in gaseous form with an initial photospheric surface at a temperature of 16,000 K or higher and a radius more than 20% greater than that of the Earth. This hot mantle surface should lead to the hydrodynamic escape of the Earth's primordial atmosphere and must be taken explicitly into a account in any calculations of the evolution of the orbiting disk. The results lead naturally to a Giant Blowoff hypothesis. Not only can the primitive atmosphere escape, but so can large amounts of mantle material which flows over the surface of the orbiting disk and blows off in the forward direction. Because of the greater volatility of SiO, the Mg/Si and Fe/Si ratios in the Earth are likely to increase. Large amounts of angular momentum can also be lost. This greatly extends the range of interesting parameters that can be seriously considered in the Giant Impact hypothesis. ?? 1991.", "identifiers": {"scopus": "2-s2.0-0000394191", "pmid": "11542164", "issn": "10902643", "isbn": "0019-1035", "doi": "10.1016/0019-1035(91)90046-V"}, "source": "Icarus", "authors": [{"first_name": "A.

This hypothesis also implies that the depletions of Cr, V, and Mn which are observed in the Moon were inherited from the mantle of the impactor. Experiments have been undertaken to determine whether the formation of an iron core within a differentiated giant planetesimal could have caused depletions of Cr, V, and Mn in the planetesimal mantle, owing to siderophile behavior of these elements during core formation. Partition coefficients of Cr, V, and Mn between metallic iron and the principal mineral phases present in the mantle of a giant planetesimal have been determined at 1500-2000??C and at 3-25 GPa using an MA-8 apparatus. Cr, V, and Mn were found to remain lithophile (D silicate/metal >1) under these conditions. It follows that the formation of an iron core within a giant planetesimal would not have caused any depletion of Cr, V, and Mn in its mantle. Depletions of Cr and V (relative to Mg) cannot be attributed to selective volatilization in the solar nebula, prior to planetesimal and planet formation because V is less volatile than Mg, whilst the condensation temperature of Cr is similar to that of Mg and higher than that of Si. Accordingly, it is concluded that the depletions of Cr and V (and probably Mn) in the Moon were not inherited from the mantle of a giant planetesimal. Cr, V, and Mn are depleted (relative to Mg) in the Earth's mantle and the terrestrial depletions for these elements are similar to the lunar depletion factor.

We consider the implications of this hypothesis for natal rotation rates of both terrestrial and gas giant planets. It is found that both types of planets may rotate near their break up angular frequencies at birth. The direction of the spin should coincide with that of the parent disc and the star, except in cases of embryos that had close interactions or mergers with other embryos in the past. Furthermore, the large repository of specific angular momentum at birth also allows formation of close binary rocky planets inside the same embryos.

The, latter are analyzed along the three phases of the US-American suburbanization process - starting from the Victorian construct of suburbia from the mind of symbolic dichotomies via the Fordist generalization and consolidation of Suburbia to the post-fordist dissolution of suburbia into a new city.

It ensures the correct action of the regulator over the whole operating range. This important aspect has also been validated. A sensorless method is presented for the determination of the rotor angle, which is needed in the control strategy. Measurements performed on a low-power system validate the method. Finally, comparisons between simulations and measurements performed on a low-power system validate not only the complete control strategy but also the DC unbalance control, the sensorless method, and the modeling of the overall system.

Never more so than with Operation Shylock: A Confession.                 Curious, as well as mindful of his tender reputation, Roth, who has to go to Israel anyway to interview a novelist for an article, decides to confront the other Roth - let's call him \"Roth 2.\" They meet and Roth 2 turns out to be a weeping, cajoling trickster. He's a private detective by trade who insists he really was born Philip Roth and that he has loved and admired the author since he first read his books. Roth 2 also believes that under his guidance the novelist will come to realize the wisdom of diasporism. Half way through the book, just as the reader is losing patience trying to figure out his game, Roth 2 pulls off the biggest joke of all and simply disappears.                 Roth 2 seems to be a 300-page red herring. But then again maybe he isn't. The man may be a PLO agent or a Mossad plant.

Ziad wants Roth to rendezvous with Jewish PLO supporters in Athens - Roth's prestige would be a boon to the organization. Roth also meets a man named Smilesburger, a retired New York jewelry store owner who mistakes Roth the writer for Roth the diasporist and presents him with a check for $1-million to help start the emigration plan.

Despite the considerable progress achieved recently, the design of a pneumatic transport system remains essentially an experimental art rather than a well-founded science. This is due to the complex mechanics involved in particle-particle, particle-gas, part\u2019icle-pipe interactions mhich are difficult to isolate experimentally. One of the important parameters for calculating the pressure drop and power consumption of the transport lines is the solid particle velocit\u2019y. Thus, a knowledge of the velocity is necessary for calculating acceleration losses and friction losses in a pneumatic conveying system. Gnfortunat\u2019ely, no unified and accurate approach exists. It is the intention of this paper to present a method to estimat\u2019e the solid particle velocity in vertical pneumatic transport lines.

The first deployment of the AP1000\u00ae plant formally began in July 2007 when Westinghouse Electric Company and its consortium partner, the Shaw Group (now CB&I), signed contracts with China\u2019s State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation Ltd., Sanmen Nuclear Power Company Ltd., and Shandong Nuclear Power Company Ltd. for four AP1000\u00ae units on coastal sites of Sanmen and Haiyang, China. Both sites have the planned ability to accommodate at least six AP1000\u00ae units. Construction for all four units is largely concurrent. Additionally, the United States (US) Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued combined licenses (COLs) to allow Southern Nuclear Operating Company (SNC) & South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G) to construct and operate AP1000\u00ae plants at the existing Vogtle & VC Summer sites in Georgia and South Carolina, respectively. Although construction at both US sites is underway, the first four China AP1000\u00ae plants will become operational ahead of the U.S. Domestic AP1000\u00ae plants. One of the major passive safety systems, the AP1000\u00ae plant passive containment cooling system (PCS), is designed to remove heat from the reactor containment building in the event of an accident. After a release of energy inside the containment building, the pressure and temperature of the containment atmosphere increase, and actuates the PCS. Water is supplied to the top of the containment from a large tank of water atop the concrete shield building. An air flow path is provided which admits air through a series of louvers near the top of the shield building. The air travels downward in an outer annulus formed by the inside surface of the concrete shield building, and a baffle structure between the shield building and the containment. The air turns 180-deg at the bottom of the annulus, and enters an inner annulus between the baffle and the containment wall. Air is exhausted through a large chimney in the top of the shield building. Air is heated in the inner annulus by the relatively warmer containment wall, and rises due to buoyancy compared to the cooler, denser air outside the building. Heat is removed from the containment through a combination of convection between the air and the containment wall, and, in the case of an accident, evaporation of the applied water film. Computer simulation of the AP1000\u00ae containment requires accurate representation of the important phenomena such as the air flow characteristics and the heat and mass transfer from the containment wall to the water film and air. Natural circulation air flow is highly dependent on the overall flow resistance in the flow path. To better understand these phenomena, a series of scale model tests of the AP1000\u00ae PCS NURETH-16,were performed. One test, the PCS Air Flow Path Characterization Test determined the flow resistance characteristics of a 1:6 scale model section of the PCS air flow path. The data were used to develop loss coefficients which were used to simulate the AP1000\u00ae PCS. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the test was developed and benchmarked against the test data. The model was expanded to simulate the full-scale AP1000\u00ae PCS maintaining the mesh density used in the test. The resulting model can be used to confidently predict the PCS air flow characteristics without the need of a full-scale test. The CFD model was used to verify the loss coefficients developed in the", "authors": [{"first_name": "Richard F", "last_name": "Wright"}, {"first_name": "Megan E", "last_name": "Durse"}, {"first_name": "Todd", "last_name": "Sutton"}], "source": "NURETH-16", "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/analysis-ap1000-passive-containment-cooling-system-air-flow-path-using-computational-fluid-dynamics", "year": 2015, "type": "conference_proceedings", "id": "19f2e777-a545-3728-913d-105e6006577c"}, {"title": "A HOMOPOLAR FOR THE DEMONSTRATION OF NEW HIGH CURRENT BRUSHES", "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that very high currents can be transferred efficiently across sliding electrical contacts under laboratory conditions.

After his studies and a short stay in the Netherlands, Himmelreich left for Rome in the early 1920's as the personal secretary of the Franciscan minister general. It was there that he met the Crutched friar Anton van Asseldonk (1892-1973). The resulting trio played a little-researched role in interwar relations between Catholicism and Judaism and their adherents both nationally and internationally. They were the initiators of the international movement Amici Israel, which was discontinued in 1928 by the Holy Office because of its sympathy with Zionism and the abandonment of traditional substitution theology. Himmelreich developed a chiliastic theology that was unusual within the Catholic Church at the time. Within this theology, contemporary Judaism was given its own meaning: Zionism was seen as a \"sign\" for the return of Christ, and the necessity for individual confession was made a topic of discussion. Himmelreich survived internment in Dachau, but after the war was not given permission by Church authorities to go to Palestine (later Israel) to start a kind of Catholic kibbutz; that was the idea of Sophie van Leer, with whom Himmelreich remained friends throughout his life.

From Turkey\u2019s perspective, Iraq\u2019s disintegration would remove a critical counterweight to Iranian influence and, more ominously, herald the birth of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq that could inspire Kurdish nationalist passions inside Turkey.

Oversight agencies, which should have been less exposed to risk because of their lack of direct contact with the general population, were forced to roll back their operations, leaving state institutions without effective safeguards against corruption or abuse.

As a consequence, the first immigration acts were passed in 1905, 1914 and 1919 and they endowed the Home Secretary and immigration officers with wide powers over the entry of aliens. This stricter atmosphere towards immigration also manifested itself in the government's policy towards Russian refugees. From the beginning, the British government adopted a strict policy against the entry of Russian refugees to Britain, despite the fact that it had been the most active foreign government supporting anti-Bolshevik forces in the Civil War in Russia.", "identifiers": {"issn": "0954-6545", "doi": "10.1080/09546549908575698"}, "source": "Revolutionary Russia", "authors": [{"first_name": "Elina", "last_name": "Multanen"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/british-policy-towards-russian-refugees-aftermath-bolshevik-revolution", "year": 1999, "type": "journal", "id": "fde242d2-329f-3d1f-82c2-1b59ef7efb2f"}, {"title": "Linguistics and the Study of Comics.", "abstract": "Do Irish superheroes actually sound Irish?

Even a decade earlier, when Edwin Arnold was conceiving and writing The Light of Asia, there was already a large and growing number of books in English about Buddhism and translations of Buddhist texts, although the subject was not nearly so popular as Arnold's bestselling poem would soon make it. It is a misconception that the Europeans of a century ago had no accurate knowledge of, and little interest in, the cultures and religions of Asia . While the interest had been growing for over a hundred years, however, the knowledge was mostly of recent origin and dated from the discovery by European scholars, in roughly the second quarter of the nineteenth century, of voluminous Buddhist religious texts in Nepal, Tibet, Mongolia and Ceylon. Within a remarkably short time enough of this material had been translated or made the basis of books about Buddhism to create, if not satisfy, an interest which soon spread beyond the circle of professional philologists and Orientalists. In the late eighteenth century Sir William Jones, a leading Sanskrit scholar, had expressed the opinion that Buddha was simply an Oriental corruption of the name of the god Odin. Seventy- five years later his successors were searching learnedly through a mass of literature in five or six languages for the historical Buddha, and their researches were having not merely scholarly but philosophical and religious impact on English and European society.

Immediate among them is the glaring lack of material. The organizations representing these religions are not, on the whole, statistics conscious. In some instances, this can be a matter of principle, a concern for quality and the transcendental rather than quantity and the material. As the major religions in question are closely identified with communities whose origins are to be found in South Asia, the reason is often cultural, manifesting itself in an interest in orders of magnitude rather than accuracy of detail. For the same reason, there is a deep-seated reluctance to divulge membership and finance statistics that, it is feared, can be used to adverse effect by opponents or government departments. A deeper problem is the institutional expression of the various religions. The structures being developed in the United Kingdom among, for example, Muslims and Sikhs are often radically different from the traditional structures of these religions.", "identifiers": {"doi": "10.1016/B978-0-08-034778-3.50013-5", "isbn": "9780080347783"}, "source": "Religion", "authors": [{"first_name": "L.M.", "last_name": "BARLEY"}, {"first_name": "C.D.", "last_name": "FIELD"}, {"first_name": "B.A.", "last_name": "KOSMIN"}, {"first_name": "J.S.", "last_name": "NIELSEN"}, {"first_name": "JORGEN S.", "last_name": "NIELSEN"}], "link": "http://www.mendeley.com/research/religion-376", "year": 1987, "type": "book", "id": "0a98e30b-cd17-3bb2-8f97-2372881edd8d"}, {"title": "Images of man: studies in religion and anthropology : lectures by distinguished visiting scholars at Wake Forest University", "abstract": "A series of 8 essays on the nature & conditions of mankind as viewed by the disciplines of theology & anthropology, vol I in the Luce Program on Religion and the Social Crisis series edited by Carlton T. Mitchell, with a Preface by Mitchell. The essays are organized as follows: J. William Angell-Images of Man in the Hebrew-Jewish-Christian Tradition-discusses observations concerning the nature & destiny of man found in the Old Testament, new elements & emphases of the early Christians as reflected in the New Testament, & new influences on the original teachings throughout the development of the Christian tradition. It is argued that the current \"Age of Anxiety\" calls for a radical reappraisal of the condition & capacities of mankind. Robert F. Spencer-Order and Disorder in the House of Islam-approaches Islam as a distinctive culture as well as a religion & defines the religious & social \"pillars\" on which the socioreligious complex of Islam rests. The varying impacts of the West on modern Islamic states are considered, & the problem of reconciling the acceptance of Western technology with a renewed search for traditional values is viewed as a source of confusion among today's Muslims. Melford E. Spiro-Images of Man, Nature, and the Supernatural in the Buddhist Schema of Salvation-outlines the unique composite images of man, nature, & the supernatural pertaining to the Buddhist conception of salvation found in the texts of Theravada Buddhism & contrasts these with the configurations in other salvation religions. However, the images in the minds of ordinary Buddhists are shown to differ from the texts & to resemble other gospels of suffering & deliverance. Thus, Buddhist beliefs are viewed as a variant of a universal cultural pattern reflecting a \"transcultural human nature\". Edward Farley-Toward a Contemporary Theology of Human Being-considers the Christian view of human being not as timeless dogma but as a loosely connected collection of insights that can critically interrogate & be criticized by the culture of its time. Theodore Runyon-The Human Being as a Theological Animal: A Biblical Argument against Creationism-argues that human beings are inevitably theological creatures, analyzes how the theological impulse among the Hebrews during the Babylonian exile expressed itself in the creation account of Genesis, & observes how biblical faith draws on the scientific knowledge of its time in order to express its own distinctive perspective. Harvey G. Cox-Religion Returns to the Secular City-argues that the unexpected return of religion as a potent social force in the 1980s implies that the current weakened \"center\" of modern theology will be dismantled, & predicts that the content of a new theology will come from a combination of traditional religion & radical Christianity. James L. Peacock-Community, Nature, and Meaning: The Anthropological Vision of the Good Life-discusses the philosophical tradition of individualism & the anthropological perspective of holism in relation to American culture, & argues that the denominational private religious group can combine individualism & holism. E. Pendleton Banks-Anthropology and Theology: Confrontation or Dialogue?-examines the possibilities for fruitful dialogue between theologians & anthropologists & comments on the foregoing essays in terms of their contributions to such a dialogue. 114 References.
